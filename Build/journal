  abstract = {Summary Mark Weiser originated the term ubiquitous computing (ubicomp),
	creating a vision of people and smart environments augmented with
	computational resources that provide information and services when
	and where desired. What is clear from this articulation of ubicomp
	is that people and their activities are central to this vision and
	realizing the vision requires us to address a number of clear goals.
	First, the everyday practices of people need to be understood and
	supported. Second, the world needs to be augmented through the provisioning
	of heterogeneous devices offering different forms of interactive
	experience. The networked devices must be orchestrated to provide
	for a holistic user experience. In this chapter, we will overview
	how these human-centered goals have impacted research in three areas
	relevant to smart environments: the definition of the appropriate
	physical interaction experience; discovering general application
	features; and the evolution of theories and practices for designing
	and evaluating the human experience in smart environments. Though
	we will provide examples from many other research efforts, we will
	conclude this chapter with concrete examples from our own work in
	classrooms and the home.},

	Theory, the language as action principle, and speech understanding
	research, we argue that smoothed s are very appropriate for this

	3 smart home installations. The data showed a classic Zipf or power-law

	above the baseline for the deployments of 16, 76 and 70 sensors.
	While we cannot directly compare this result with other work (lack

	require the availability of network services that provide even simple
	notions of context as position and identity. In the last few years
	several localization and tracking systems for indoor environment
	have been proposed. However, these systems are often very expensive
	since they require the installation of dedicated infrastructures
	of sensors based on radio, ultrasound or infrared technologies, to
	determine the user position. This paper aims to propose and analyze
	a novel indoor localization and tracking system based on the Bluetooth
	technology. This is a short-range, low complexity and low cost wireless
	technology that supports explicit device discovery services. The
	proposed localization system fully integrates these device discovery
	procedures into the infrastructure-based network of Bluetooth access
	points that provides the wireless connectivity inside a building.
	This design approach guarantees a cost-effective solution for the
	positioning service implementation. In this paper we have extensively
	investigated through simulative analysis the performances of the
	proposed localization system, showing that it has a negligible overhead,
	still providing a timely update of user location.

	domains, including robotics, distributed control, telecommunications,
	and economics. The complexity of many tasks arising in these domains
	makes them difficult to solve with preprogrammed agent behaviors.
	The agents must, instead, discover a solution on their own, using
	learning. A significant part of the research on multiagent learning
	concerns reinforcement learning techniques. This paper provides a
	comprehensive survey of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL).
	A central issue in the field is the formal statement of the multiagent
	learning goal. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the
	proposal of many different goals, among which two focal points can
	be distinguished: stability of the agents' learning dynamics, and
	adaptation to the changing behavior of the other agents. The MARL
	algorithms described in the literature aim---either explicitly or
	implicitly---at one of these two goals or at a combination of both,
	in a fully cooperative, fully competitive, or more general setting.
	A representative selection of these algorithms is discussed in detail
	in this paper, together with the specific issues that arise in each
	category. Additionally, the benefits and challenges of MARL are described
	along with some of the problem domains where the MARL techniques
	have been applied. Finally, an outlook for the field is provided.},

	increasingly prevalent in today's pervasive computing applications.
	Among the well-established location determination approaches, probabilistic
	techniques show good performance and, thus, become increasingly popular.
	For these techniques to achieve a high level of accuracy, however,
	a large number of training samples are usually required for calibration,
	which incurs a great amount of offline manual effort. In this paper,
	we aim to solve the problem by reducing both the sampling time and
	the number of locations sampled in constructing a radio map. We propose
	a novel learning algorithm that builds location-estimation systems
	based on a small fraction of the calibration data that traditional
	techniques require and a collection of user traces that can be cheaply
	obtained. When the number of sampled locations is reduced, an interpolation
	method is developed to effectively patch a radio map. Extensive experiments
	show that our proposed methods are effective in reducing the calibration
	effort. In particular, unlabeled user traces can be used to compensate
	for the effects of reducing the calibration effort and can even improve
	the system performance. Consequently, manual effort can be reduced
	substantially while a high level of accuracy is still achieved},

	This paper describes a context-aware middleware providing an automatic

	context-aware middleware includes an appliance controller, a context-aware
	agent and a scalable browser. The appliance controller takes charge
	of communication between appliances in the context-aware middleware.
	The context-aware middleware use OSGi (open service gateway initial)
	as the framework of the home network. The scalable browser recognizes
	the properties of all the rendering device, and it figures out their
	screen size. We use UlML (user interface markup language) as multiple
	rendering device. The context-aware agent utilizes 6 basic data values
	for learning and predicting the user's preference for the home appliances:
	the pulse, the body temperature, the facial expression, the room
	temperature, the time, and the location. The six data sets construct
	the context model and are used by the context manager module. The
	user profile manager maintains the history information for home appliances
	chosen by the user. The user-pattern learning and predicting module
	is based on a neural network, which predicts the proper home service

  abstract = {Most of us still think of fingerprint analysis as a kind of gold standard
	of criminal forensics, expressly developed as an indisputable means
	of catching the bad guy. Cole points out that these assumptions aren't
	necessarily warranted. Fingerprinting was initially utilized in British-ruled
	India and with Chinese immigrants in the United States simply to
	sort out people. Only later was it used for criminal identification
	and even later still as forensic evidence. For many years, it was
	secondary to the Bertillon system of anthropometric measurement as
	a method of identifying criminals. Finally, after a half-century
	as that forensic gold standard, it was called into question by issues
	of print forgery, incompetent examiners, and the methodology of latent
	print identification, allowing DNA typing to assume the role of a
	possible new forensic standard. A fascinating bit of social history
	but rough going for the lay reader in its technical discussions,

  review = {Cole's comprehensive first book investigates the tangled intersections
	of scientific identification and law enforcement, entering similar
	territory as Colin Beavan's Fingerprints (see review above), but
	with more rigorous detail and attention to historical ambiguities.
	Cole, with a Ph.D. in science and technology studies, describes how
	the anonymity of the growing cities introduced "identification as
	a problem without a solution" (prefigured by the 16th-century Martin
	Guerre case in which the suspect's identity remained in question
	after the conflicting testimonies of 150 of his townsmen), even as
	the need was developing to identify and isolate career criminals.
	Bertillonage, the foremost anthropometry (bodily measurement) system,
	was believed to be a breakthrough and persisted into the 1930s. Cole
	details decades of conflict and competition between Bertillon's advocates
	and those of the radical and haphazardly developing science of fingerprinting
	(which was initially envisioned for civil verification, e.g., for
	payrolls). Although successful prosecutions heralded the embrace
	of fingerprinting by the 1920s, controversy involving partial or
	single prints kept validity at bay. Furthermore, the lack of a single,
	central fingerprint database "made fingerprinting a somewhat empty
	promise," as did the incompatibility of competing fingerprinting
	systems. Political overtones surface as Cole tracks America's war
	on crime, beginning when J. Edgar Hoover unsuccessfully sought universal
	fingerprinting. Late chapters like "Fraud, Fabrication, and False
	Positives" address recent developments including the controversial
	certification process for fingerprint examiners, defense attorney
	attacks on examiner credibility or corruption, and what Cole portrays

	Also, it is generally assumed that, due to bandwidth constraints,

	differs in that we develop a real-time, recursive approach to the

	track fuser, allowing for improved track fusion performance. While
	the algorithm can be readily modified to operate in decentralized

	This is particularly useful when sensor revisit rates vary greatly.
	
	
	Our track fusion algorithm uses an efficient linear programming-based
	approach to data association and a customized version of the interacting
	multiple model (IMM) filter with precise calculations for model transition
	probabilities and for model-to-model filter predictions. Data association

	to as a quasi-tracklet. Due to some important practical considerations,
	the impact of maneuvering targets on the performance of tracklets
	has not been thoroughly addressed in the literature. An investigation
	that includes the critical practical considerations requires computer
	simulations with realistic target maneuvers and pertinent evaluation
	criteria (i.e., computation of errors). In this paper, some of the
	practical issues concerning the use of tracklets for tracking maneuvering
	targets are discussed, and the results from a simulation study of
	the impact of target maneuvers on tracking with tracklets are given.
	The study considered a fusion tracker receiving tracklets from multiple
	sensors at dispersed locations and targets maneuvering with either
	random accelerations or deterministic maneuvers. Tracklets from measurements
	and tracklets from tracks were studied. Since process noise was added
	to sensor and fusion trackers to account for target maneuvers, the
	tracklet methods studied are technically quasi-tracklets. A novel
	technique is used to compare the performance of tracklets for targets
	maneuvering randomly with that for targets performing deterministic
	maneuvers.},

  abstract = {In the past few years the field of pervasive computing has expanded
	and infiltrated down to everyday consumer activities. Smartness of
	devices is constantly increasing. Smart products are widespread,
	not just limited to appliances and electronics. With the availability
	of such products, there becomes an increased need for scalable smart
	environments that are capable of integrating them to harness their
	combined benefits. Sensing a space to find out about its devices
	and opportunities they offer is a particularly important capability
	in smart spaces. For example, it is very useful to be able to discover
	the location of a certain device, reason about its role and possible
	participation in a certain application, and finally be able to control
	it remotely. Such self sensing and delegation of control is needed
	by many applications like remotely pinpointing the location of a
	certain device that is causing some kind of threat. Self sensing
	requires world modeling when physical world entities are mapped into
	model artifacts. In this dissertation, we introduce three approaches
	to creating useful world models. First, we present SensoBot, a mobile
	sensor platform that has the ability of mapping the space, creating
	the respective floor plan, locating important landmarks, and approximately
	locating furniture. In addition, we discuss the implementation of
	smart plugs, a novel way to locate and control smart devices within
	a real smart house.
	
	
	We then propose a novel approach in which classical computer vision
	algorithms are empowered by opportunities presented by the pervasive
	space. Our approach, which we call PerVision, extends classical object
	recognition and tracking algorithms by adding a self-assessment/adjustment
	loop in which sensors and actuators of the pervasive space are used
	to vary scene parameters to minimize errors in the recognition process.
	We present the PerVision concept and algorithms in the context of
	locating and tracking dumb objects such as furniture in a smart house.
	Collectively, SensoBot, Smart Plugs, and PerVision take us a few
	steps closer to realizing the ambitious vision of completely self
	sensing spaces.},

	of large planar segments, such as walls and ceilings, which are
	
	assumed to remain static. Using this map as input, the KMCL

	underlying sensor image formation model to efficiently generate

	using a graphical processing unit (GPU). The generated 3D
	
	views of the scene are then used to evaluate the likelihood of
	
	the particle poses. This GPU implementation provides a factor

	Product Description
	
	The housing problems of older people in our society are highly topical
	because of the growing number of retired people in the population
	and, especially, the yet-to-come increasing number of "very old"
	people. Government policies on the care of older people have been
	forthcoming from Whitehall, but the issue of housing is just beginning
	to be seriously addressed. This book represents an attempt at bringing
	together people from the worlds of architecture, social science and
	housing studies to look at the future of living environments for
	an ageing society. Projecting thinking into the future, it asks critical
	questions and attempts to provide some of the answers. It moves beyond
	the issues of accommodation and care to look at the wider picture
	of how housing can reflect the social inclusion of people as they
	age. "Inclusive housing in an ageing society" should appeal to a
	wide audience - housing, health and social care workers including:
	housing officers, architects, planners and designers, community regeneration
	workers, care managers, social workers and social care assistants,
	registered managers and housing providers, health improvement staff
	and, of course, current and future generations of older people.},

	arrive from widely disparate climates and have high expectations
	of the thermal environment. Their short-term occupancy (for periods

	for thermal comfort control. We examined the hotel complaint log,
	collected detailed physical measurements of the thermal environment
	in typical hotel rooms, assessed the HVAC (heating, ventilating and
	air-conditioning) system capacity and response time, and surveyed
	315 hotel guests over a five-month period. The results of this study
	led to the design of a thermostat control system (the [`]comfortstat')

	an infrared occupancy sensor, door switch, radiant temperature sensor,

  abstract = {Despite the increasing use of DNA evidence and other sophisticated
	forensic techniques in crime solving, fingerprints still serve as
	an indispensable tool of modern-day criminal investigation. This
	fascinating book, originally published in 1892, represents the first
	thorough investigation of this anatomical peculiarity and its application
	in establishing individual identity for use in law enforcement. Sir
	Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin and a member of the Royal
	Geographical Society, had already made a reputation for himself as
	an explorer of Africa and the founder of the new field of eugenics
	when he turned his attention to the subject of fingerprints. Based
	upon extensive research at his "anthropometric laboratory," Galton
	lays out an elementary system of classifying fingerprints based on
	observed patterns of arches, loops, and whorls. Based on his own
	meticulous drawings as well as photographs of ink prints, he shows
	that "the numerous bifurcations, origins, islands, and enclosures
	in the ridges that compose the pattern, are proved to be almost beyond
	change." Thus, he established a sure method of individual identification.
	Galton?s system was later modified by Sir Edward R. Henry, who became
	chief of police in London. In 1901, Scotland Yard officially adopted
	the Galton-Henry system of fingerprinting. Today, it is the most
	widely used system of fingerprint classification in the world. This
	classic work will make a welcome addition to the libraries of historians,
	criminologists, and fans of true crime and forensic science.},

	We actually collected over two minutes of data per office or region,

	Even in the most pathological cases, we almost never localize a user
	any more distant than to the neighboring office. A user can obtain
	this level of accuracy with only two or three signal intensity measurements,
	allowing for a high frame rate of localization results. Furthermore,
	with a brief calibration period, our system can be adapted to work

	Location Technology The topology of a fixed network of wireless receivers
	is the basis for a location system. The position of a mobile wireless
	transmitter is determined by the identity of the receivers within
	the network. Increasing the density of receivers allows the transmitter
	power to be reduced and the granularity of location to be refined.
	Location boundaries become well-defined if the wavelength is such
	that transmissions do not pass through walls. This property is exploited
	in the ORL infra-red network. 1.1 Room scale location},

	In most modern video games, the set of content shipped with the game
	is static and unchanging, or at best, randomized within a narrow
	set of parameters. However, ideally, if game content could be constantly
	renewed, players would remain engaged longer in the evolving stream
	of novel content. To realize this ambition, this paper introduces
	the content-generating neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (cgNEAT)
	algorithm, which automatically evolves game content based on player
	preferences, as the game is played. To demonstrate this approach,
	the galactic arms race (GAR) video game is also introduced. In GAR,
	players pilot space ships and fight enemies to acquire unique particle
	system weapons that are evolved by the game. As shown in this paper,
	players can discover a wide variety of content that is not only novel,
	but also based on and extended from previous content that they preferred
	in the past. The implication is that it is now possible to create
	games that generate their own content to satisfy players, potentially
	significantly reducing the cost of content creation and increasing
	the replay value of games.},

	negative label (NL) and propose a novel approach called NL propagation
	(NLP) to efficiently make use of this type of information to assist
	the process of semisupervised learning. Specifically, NLP assumes
	that nearby points should have similar class indicators. The data
	labels are propagated under the guidance of NL information and the
	geometric structure revealed by both labeled and unlabeled points,
	by employing some specified initialization and parameter matrices.
	The convergence analysis, out-of-sample extension, parameter determination,

	This paper designs a Ubiquitous Multimedia Information Delivering
	Service (U-MIDS) for smart home, U-MIDS can automatically deliver
	multimedia information, such as MP3 music, Internet radios, (Text-to-Speech)
	spoken online news, and personal spoken messages, to the residents
	according to their positions and behaviors in a smart home. Basically,
	the U-MIDS consists of RFID modules, embedded network media players
	and a U-MIDS gateway. RFID modules are used to identify the identities
	of home residents and which room they locate. An embedded network
	media player is a device broadcasting multimedia information to home
	residents. The U-MIDS gateway can control these network media players
	to play desirable spoken information, music, etc. Besides, we also
	integrate semantic concepts and inference rules into the U-MIDS hoping
	home smarter. That is, the gateway of U-MIDS can automatically provide
	proper multimedia services for its residents according to residents?
	preferences, locations, situations, etc. Through our proposed U-MIDS,
	the residents can be freely and easily gather the ubiquitous multimedia
	information upon their locations, preferences, and home intelligence

	by means of image and video processing. The disadvantages of such
	surveillance systems is that if an object needs to be tracked- it
	has to be observed by a video camera. However, geometries of indoor

	the coverage necessary for robust operation of video-based tracking
	algorithms. Increased number of video streams increases the computational

	here includes over 200 motion sensors as well as 6 moving cameras.
	We track individuals in the entire space and across cameras using
	contextual information available from the motion sensors. Motion
	sensors allow us to almost instantaneously find plausible tracks
	in a very large volume of data, ranging in months, which for traditional
	video search approaches could be virtually impossible. We describe
	a method that allows us to evaluate when the tracking system is unreliable

	sensors are commonplace in practically every office space, and are
	slowly making their way into living spaces. The application of such

	also violates privacy. On the other hand, motion sensors, while being
	privacy-conscious, typically do not provide enough information for
	a human operator to maintain the same degree of awareness about the

  abstract = {Biometrics is rapidly gaining acceptance as the technology that can
	meet the ever increasing need for security in critical applications.
	Biometric systems automatically recognize individuals based on their
	physiological and behavioral characteristics. Hence, the fundamental
	requirement of any biometric recognition system is a human trait
	having several desirable properties like universality, distinctiveness,
	permanence, collectability, acceptability, and resistance to circumvention.
	However, a human characteristic that possesses all these properties
	has not yet been identified. As a result, none of the existing biometric
	systems provide perfect recognition and there is a scope for improving
	the performance of these systems. Although characteristics like gender,
	ethnicity, age, height, weight and eye color are not unique and reliable,
	they provide some information about the user. We refer to these characteristics
	as ?soft ? biometric traits and argue that these traits can complement
	the identity information provided by the primary biometric identifiers
	like fingerprint and face. This paper presents the motivation for
	utilizing soft biometric information and analyzes how the soft biometric
	traits can be automatically extracted and incorporated in the decision
	making process of the primary biometric system. Preliminary experiments
	were conducted on a fingerprint database of 160 users by synthetically
	generating soft biometric traits like gender, ethnicity, and height
	based on known statistics. The results show that the use of additional
	soft biometric user information significantly improves ( ? 6%) the

  abstract = {Ubiquitous computing environments typically contain a large number
	and a large variety of networked sensors that are often embedded
	in the environment. As these networks grow in size and complexity,
	their management becomes increasingly costly, for instance in terms
	of equipment, software, and people. One way to keep these costs under
	control is to automate some or all of the management aspects in the
	system, reducing or even removing the need for human interaction.
	In this paper, we focus on automatically managing Bluetooth networks
	for indoor localization, which we consider a specific class of ubiquitous
	computing systems because they usually rely on many Bluetooth devices
	scattered throughout a particular building. We will discuss algorithms
	that help reducing the number of active devices needed in a network,
	while maintaining a comparable localization accuracy compared to
	the "full" network. The algorithms enable the most "valuable" Bluetooth
	devices in the network and will disable the others. The main advantage
	is that this reduces the need for network planning, which reduces
	the costs of operating the system. Another advantage is that it reduces

	includes a more sophisticated motion model to maintain the identity
	of targets throughout an interaction, drastically reducing tracker
	failures. The paper presents two main contributions: (1) we show

	and (2) we show how this can be done efficiently using Markov chain
	Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We prove that incorporating an MRF to

	factor to the importance weights in a joint particle filter. Since
	a joint particle filter suffers from exponential complexity in the
	number of tracked targets, we replace the traditional importance
	sampling step in the particle filter with an MCMC sampling step.
	The resulting filter deals efficiently and effectively with complicated
	interactions when targets approach each other. We present both qualitative
	and quantitative results to substantiate the claims made in the paper,

	to be necessary for supporting some features of RFID systems, such

	we propose a privacy-preserving scheme that enables anonymous estimation
	of the cardinality of a dynamic set of RFID tags, while allowing
	the set membership to vary in both the spatial and temporal domains.
	In addition, the proposed scheme can identify the dynamics of the
	changes in the tag set population. The main idea of the scheme is
	to avoid explicit identification of tags. We demonstrate that the
	proposed scheme is highly adaptive and can accurately estimate tag
	populations across many orders of magnitude, ranging from a few tens
	to millions of tags. The associated probing latency is also substantially
	lower (les 10%) than that of the schemes which require explicit tag
	identification. We also show that our proposed scheme performs well

	tracking from a single camera by progressively associating detection
	responses into longer and longer track fragments (tracklets) and
	finally the desired target trajectories. To define tracklet affinity
	for association, most previous work relies on heuristically selected
	parametric models; while our approach is able to automatically select
	among various features and corresponding non-parametric models, and
	combine them to maximize the discriminative power on training data
	by virtue of a HybridBoost algorithm. A hybrid loss function is used
	in this algorithm because the association of tracklet is formulated
	as a joint problem of ranking and classification: the ranking part
	aims to rank correct tracklet associations higher than other alternatives;
	the classification part is responsible to reject wrong associations
	when no further association should be done. Experiments are carried
	out by tracking pedestrians in challenging datasets. We compare our
	approach with state-of-the-art algorithms to show its improvement
	in terms of tracking accuracy.},

  title = {On aspects of indoor localization},
  school = {Universit\"at Dortmund},
  year = {2006},
  month = {August},
  abstract = {One of the key issues of emerging mobile computing and robotics is
	to obtain knowledge of the position of persons, vehicles and objects
	in an indoor environment. In order to enable a pervasive coverage,
	this must be achieved at low cost. Due to the importance of this
	problem, numerous solutions have been proposed. In this thesis two
	important localization techniques are discussed and major improvements
	are developed to address their weaknesses. A common approach for
	the position estimation problem is hyperbolic localization. This
	method is based on time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements
	of signals transmitted from the mobile unit, i.e. the unit that is
	to be located, to a set of fixed reference units. A key requirement
	of this technique is that the clocks of the reference devices are
	synchronized. Unfortunately, if electromagnetic signals are used
	that travel at the speed of light even a very small clock deviation
	results in a tremendous inaccuracy of the computed location. Therefore,
	a highly precise time measurement and synchronization is mandatory
	for these systems. However, clocks operating at the required resolution
	and precision are complex and thus expensive. In this thesis, a localization
	approach based on TDOA measurements that implies clock synchronization
	is proposed and discussed. It allows for the usage of low cost oscillators
	that operate at a moderate frequency in the order of 100 MHz. The
	impact of short and long term instabilities like jitter or clock
	drift are inherently delimited. The approach can be applied to radio
	or infrared as well as ultrasound based systems. The main advantage
	of this approach is that common synchronization mechanisms that require
	a significant amount of processing and/or hardware resources can
	be neglected. Hence, this method is well suited for applications
	where the mobile unit must be very low cost and thus, of low complexity.
	An alternative to hyperbolic localization is triangulation, which
	requires the measurement of angles among fixed reference units and
	the mobile target. In this work, an infrared detector array for angle
	of arrival measurement is presented. The array consists of multiple
	sensing elements that are orientated in different directions. First,
	the arrangement is described by a sampling system. However, it is
	shown that low cost integrated receivers yield various aberrations,
	and thus the sampling approach fails. Subsequently, a new approach
	named virtual filter interpolation is proposed and discussed. This
	approach can handle individual sensitivity characteristics of each
	sensor element and therefore outperforms the sampling approach. The
	proposed technique is qualified for extremely low cost localization,
	e.g. for robot navigation.},

	a post-processing, batch approach to track-to-track association.
	Also, it is generally assumed that, due to bandwidth constraints,
	sensor contacts are unavailable to the track fusion system. Our work
	differs in that we develop a real-time, recursive approach to the
	track fusion problem. Further, our algorithm was developed for a
	centralized architecture, so that sensor data is available to the
	track fuser, allowing for improved track fusion performance. While
	the algorithm can be readily modified to operate in decentralized
	settings when bandwidth constraints are such that sensor contacts
	are unavailable to the track fuser, our work motivates a hierarchical,
	multi-stage approach to data fusion even in centralized settings.
	This is particularly useful when sensor revisit rates vary greatly.
	
	
	Our track fusion algorithm uses an efficient linear programming-based
	approach to data association and a customized version of the interacting
	multiple model (IMM) filter with precise calculations for model transition
	probabilities and for model-to-model filter predictions. Data association
	is based on kinematic as well as classification information. We present

	as a general sleep analysis tool. Overnight sleep studies were conducted
	on 40 healthy subjects during a clinical trial at the University

	rate were compared to ECG, pulse oximetry, and respiratory inductance
	plethysmography (RIP). The subjects were split into a training dataset
	and a validation dataset, maintaining similar demographics in each
	set. The NAPS system accurately detected heart rate, averaged over
	the prescribed 30-s epochs, to within less than 2.72 beats per minute
	of ECG, and accurately detected breathing rate, averaged over the

	the smart environment by a state transition system: Each state records
	a set of individuals who are present in various zones of the environment.
	Since biometric recognition is inexact, state information is probabilistic
	in nature. An event abstracts a biometric recognition step, and the
	transition function abstracts the reasoning necessary to effect state
	transitions. In this manner, we are able to accommodate different
	types of biometric sensors and also different criteria for state
	transitions. We define the notions of ?precision? and ?recall? of
	a smart environment in terms of how well it is capable of identifying
	occupants. We have developed a prototype smart environment based
	upon our proposed concepts, and provide experimental results in this
	paper. Our conclusion is that the state transition model is an effective
	abstraction of a smart environment and serves as a basis for integrating

	floor sensors are low-cost and can track people in a wide area. However,
	the sensor reading is discrete and missing; therefore, footsteps
	do not represent the precise location of a person. A Markov chain
	Monte Carlo method (MCMC) is a promising tracking algorithm for these
	kinds of signals. We applied two prediction models to the MCMC: a
	linear Gaussian model and a highly nonlinear bipedal model. The Gaussian
	model was efficient in terms of computational cost while the bipedal
	model discriminated people more accurate than the Gaussian model.
	The Gaussian model can be used to track a number of people, and the
	bipedal model can be used in situations where more accurate tracking
	is required.},

  abstract = {In-home health care services based on the Internet-of-Things are promising
	to resolve the challenges caused by the ageing of population. But
	the existing research is rather scattered and shows lack of interoperability.
	In this article, a business-technology co-design methodology is proposed
	for cross-boundary integration of in-home health care devices and
	services. In this framework, three key elements of a solution (business
	model, device and service integration architecture and information
	system integration architecture) are organically integrated and aligned.
	In particular, a cooperative Health-IoT ecosystem is formulated,
	and information systems of all stakeholders are integrated in a cooperative
	health cloud as well as extended to patients' home through the in-home
	health care station (IHHS). Design principles of the IHHS includes
	the reuse of 3C platform, certification of the Health Extension,
	interoperability and extendibility, convenient and trusted software
	distribution, standardised and secured electrical health care record
	handling, effective service composition and efficient data fusion.
	These principles are applied to the design of an IHHS solution called
	iMedBox. Detailed device and service integration architecture and
	hardware and software architecture are presented and verified by
	an implemented prototype. The quantitative performance analysis and
	field trials have confirmed the feasibility of the proposed design
	methodology and solution.},

	Rather than explicitly tracking user location, Cricket helps devices
	learn where they are and lets them decide whom to advertise this
	information to; it does not rely on any centralized management or

	provides information to devices regardless of their type of network

	components and costs less than U.S. $10. We describe the randomized
	algorithm used by beacons to transmit information, the use of concurrent
	radio and ultrasonic signals to infer distance, the listener inference
	algorithms to overcome multipath and interference, and practical
	beacon configuration and positioning techniques that improve accuracy.
	Our experience with Cricket shows that several location-dependent

	One challenge of activity recognition is the need for collecting

	in order to be able to carry out the conventional activity discovery
	and recognition algorithms. This extensive initial phase of data
	collection and annotation results in a prolonged installation process

	to a new physical space in order to leverage the learning process
	in the new environment. Our method called ?Home to Home Transfer
	Learning? (HHTL) is based on using a semi EM framework and modeling
	activities using structural, temporal and spatial features. This
	method allows us to avoid the tedious task of collecting and labeling
	huge amounts of data in the target space, and allows for a more accelerated
	and more scalable deployment cycle in the real world. It also allows
	us to exploit the insights learned in previous spaces. To validate

	A voice is much more than just a string of words. Voices, unlike fingerprints,
	are inherently complex. Forensic Speaker Identification explains
	what FSI involves, and clarifies the problems of inferring identity
	from speech under the less than ideal conditions typical in forensics.
	This book has been written for forensic scientists, the legal profession
	and law enforcement officers. It's accessible to those with no previous
	knowledge of FSI, or of phonetics or acoustics. It can also be used
	as a base for teaching tertiary level courses in aspects of phonetics.
	This practical, lucid text takes the reader through all the underpinning
	knowledge necessary, and will bring much needed clarity to an important
	technique.},

  abstract = {A smart home aims at building intelligence automation with a goal
	to provide its inhabitants with maximum possible comfort, minimize
	the resource consumption and thus overall cost of maintaining the
	home. 'Context Awareness' is perhaps the most salient feature of
	such an intelligent environment. Clearly, an inhabitant's mobility
	and activities play a significant role in defining his contexts in
	and around the home. Although there exists an optimal algorithm for
	location and activity tracking of a single inhabitant, the correlation
	and dependence between multiple inhabitants' contexts within the
	same environment make the location and activity tracking more challenging.
	In this paper, we first prove that the optimal location prediction
	across multiple inhabitants in smart homes is an NP-hard problem.
	Next, to capture the correlation and interactions of different inhabitants'
	movements (and hence activities), we develop a novel framework based
	on a game theoretic, Nash H-learning approach that attempts to minimize
	the joint location uncertainty. The framework achieves a Nash equilibrium
	such that no inhabitant is given preference over others. This results
	in more accurate prediction of contexts and better adaptive control
	of automated devices, leading to a mobility-aware resource (say,
	energy) management scheme in multi-inhabitant smart homes. Experimental
	results demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of adaptively
	controlling a smart environment, thus reducing energy consumption
	and enhancing the comfort of the inhabitants.},

	The inhabitants' mobility creates uncertainty of his location and

	all the inhabitants currently present in the house attempt to minimize
	this overall uncertainty in the form of utility functions associated
	with them. Joint optimization of the utility function corresponds
	to the convergence to Nash equilibrium and helps in accurate prediction
	of inhabitants' future locations and activities. This results in
	adaptive control of automated devices and temperature of the house,
	thus providing an amicable environment and sufficient comfort to

  abstract = {Neuropsychologists are often asked to answer questions about the effects
	of cognitive deficits on everyday functioning. This study examined
	the relationship between and the cognitive correlates of self-report,
	performance-based, and direct observation measures commonly used
	as proxy measures for everyday functioning. Participants were 88
	community-dwelling, cognitively healthy older adults (age 50?86 years).
	Participants completed standardized neuropsychological tests and
	questionnaires, and performed eight activities of daily living (e.g.,
	water plants, fill a medication dispenser) while under direct observation
	in a campus apartment. All proxy measures of everyday function were
	sensitive to the effects of healthy cognitive aging. After controlling
	for age, cognitive predictors explained a unique amount of the variance
	for only the performance-based behavioral simulation measure (i.e.,
	Revised Observed Tasks of Daily Living). The self-report instrumental
	activities of daily living (IADL) and the performance-based everyday
	problem-solving test (i.e., EPT) did not correlate with each other;
	however, both were unique predictors of the direct observation measure.
	These findings suggest that neuropsychologists must be cautious in
	making predictions about the quality of everyday activity completion
	in cognitively healthy older adults from specific cognitive functions.
	The findings further suggest that a self-report of IADLs and the
	performance-based EPT may be useful measures for assessing everyday
	functional status in cognitively healthy older adults. (JINS, 2011,

  abstract = {Load balancing in electricity grids becomes a more sophisticated problem
	by the increased availability oftime-varying stochastic supply of
	electricity from conversion of renewable resources like wind orsunlight.
	Due to the fact that large quantities of electrical energy cannot
	be stored easily, demand sidemanagement by shifting electrical loads
	is one attempt to cope withthis problem. In this paper we discuss
	and compare two types of control signals to use the thermal storage
	of electrical household appliances as balancing power. As the system
	of our research consists of a high number of controllable refrigerators
	with independent parameters and behaviour, we investigatethe synergetic
	behaviour bya simulation model. For this objective we analyze a simulation
	model of controllable refrigerators withrespect to their ability
	to shift their energy demand depending on parameterized external
	signals. We show that both types of control signals can be used for
	short term reserves with delivery within 15 min of time, but they
	differ in possible shapes of the resulting load curves and in the
	reaction time of the controlled system. In addition to the simulation
	model we develop a model of the synergetic behaviour of an ensemble
	of refrigerators? reaction on control signals. This mathematical
	model predicts the electricity demand of ensembles of controlled
	appliances. As it reduces the simulation model?s complexity it could
	be used in a sophisticated control strategy, e.g. in a model predictive
	control approach. The general attempt to integrate the load shift
	potential of cooling devices into the control of an electricity grid
	can probably be transferred to other electrical appliances with thermal
	storage capacities.},

	later cognitive ability. With our partners at the University of Virginia

	The key idea that makes accurate GSM-based indoor localization possible
	is the use of wide signal-strength fingerprints. In addition to the
	6-strongest cells traditionally used in the GSM standard, the wide
	fingerprint includes readings from additional cells that are strong
	enough to be detected, but are too weak to be used for efficient

	(RFID), a technology enabling automatic identification of objects
	at a distance without requiring line-of-sight. Electronic tagging
	can be divided into technologies that have a power source (active
	tags), and those that are powered by the tag interrogation signal
	(passive tags); the focus here is on passive tags. An overview of
	the principles of the technology divides passive tags into devices
	that use either near field or far field coupling to communicate with
	a tag reader. The strengths and weaknesses of the approaches are
	considered, along with the standards that have been put in place
	by ISO and EPCGlobal to promote interoperability and the ubiquitous
	adoption of the technology. A section of the lecture has been dedicated
	to the principles of reading co-located tags, as this represents
	a significant challenge for a technology that may one day be able
	to automatically identify all of the items in your shopping cart
	in a just few seconds. In fact, RFID applications are already quite
	extensive and this lecture classifies the primary uses. Some variants
	of modern RFID can also be integrated with sensors enabling the technology
	to be extended to measure parameters in the local environment, such
	as temperature & pressure. The uses and applications of RFID sensors
	are further described and classified. Later we examine important
	lessons surrounding the deployment of RFID for the Wal-Mart and the
	Metro AG store experiences, along with deployments in some more exploratory
	settings. Extensions of RFID that make use of read/write memory integrated
	with the tag are also discussed, in particular looking at novel near
	term opportunities. Privacy and social implications surrounding the
	use of RFID inspire recurring debates whenever there is discussion
	of large scale deployment; we examine the pros and cons of the issues
	and approaches for mitigating the problems. Finally, the remaining

  abstract = {Home automation systems should evolve to the next phase in which they
	are aware of contexts, because providing services based on contexts
	will upgrade the service quality, thus making people more comfortable
	and home living more convenient. In particular, location is a piece
	of important and useful context information for seeking appropriate
	services, as well as providing them to people living in a home. So
	far, there have been several studies focused on tracking inhabitants
	in smart home environments. However, these approaches are often intrusive
	or require inhabitants to wear some sort of devices, which may make
	the inhabitants uncomfortable or even inconvenient. This problem
	could devastate the ultimate goal, which is to provide convenient
	services, and hence cause such approaches somewhat controversial.
	In this study, we utilize a number of load sensors together to construct
	a sensory floor on which exerted pressure can be detected and cover
	its surface with wooden flooring as in a normal home environment.
	Although the wooden flooring provides a flat surface for inhabitants
	to walk on, it also causes clutter in the sensor readings, which
	lead to difficulty in clearly identifying the location(s) of pressure
	source(s). Thus, we apply probabilistic data association technique
	and LeZi-Update approach to analyze the cluttered pressure readings
	collected by the load sensors so as to determine the positions of
	the inhabitants, as well as to track their movements. With our nonintrusive
	approach, there is no need for inhabitants to wear any devices, and
	this also solves the cross-walking problem in the home environment.
	Note to Practitioners-This system aims for detecting the location
	of multiple inhabitants in the home environment. We adopt the sensory
	floor as our tracking sensor, which consists of many blocks, each
	with a load cell to collect the human body weight. These blocks are
	covered with conventional wooden flooring to provide a flat surface
	on which inhabitant- s can walk freely. After collecting data, we
	apply mathematical techniques to analyze them, thus determining inhabitants'
	locations and tracking their movements. The limitation is that the
	system cannot differentiate different persons if they have close
	weight readings, which is the natural limitation of the load cell.},

	As a solution, we advocate a class of hybrid perceptual systems that
	builds a comprehensive model of activity in a large space, such as
	a building, by merging contextual information from a dense network
	of ultra-lightweight sensor nodes with video from a sparse network
	of high-capability sensors. In this paper we explore the task of
	automatically recovering the relative geometry between a pan-tilt-zoom
	camera and a network of one-bit motion detectors. We present results
	for the recovery of geometry alone, and also recovery of geometry
	jointly with simple activity models. Because we don't believe a metric
	calibration is necessary, or even entirely useful for this task,
	we formulate and pursue the novel goal we term functional calibration.
	Functional calibration is the blending of geometry estimation and
	simple behavioral model discovery. Accordingly, results are evaluated
	in terms of the ability of the system to automatically foveate targets
	in a large, non-convex space, not in terms of pixel reconstruction

	two goals: high accuracy and low computational requirements. The
	Horus system identifies different causes for the wireless channel
	variations and addresses them to achieve its high accuracy. It uses
	location-clustering techniques to reduce the computational requirements
	of the algorithm. The lightweight Horus algorithm helps in supporting
	a larger number of users by running the algorithm at the clients.We
	discuss the different components of the Horus system and its implementation
	under two different operating systems and evaluate the performance
	of the Horus system on two testbeds. Our results show that the Horus
	system achieves its goal. It has an error of less than 0.6 meter
	on the average and its computational requirements are more than an
	order of magnitude better than other WLAN location determination
	systems. Moreover, the techniques developed in the context of the
	Horus system are general and can be applied to other WLAN location
	determination systems to enhance their accuracy. We also report lessons
	learned from experimenting with the Horus system and provide directions

  abstract = {Location awareness is an important part of many ubiquitous computing
	systems, but a perfect location system does not exist yet. Among
	many location tracking systems, we choose the radio frequency identification
	(RFID) system due to its various applications. However, the received
	signal strength indicator (RSSI) signals are too sensitive to the
	direction of the RFID reader's antenna, the orientation of the RFID
	tag, human interference, and the diversity of propagation media that
	might be present. As a result, the direct use of a conventional particle
	filter does not provide satisfactory tracking performance. To overcome
	this problem, we suggest a dual layer particle filter, where the
	lower layer determines the tag's location in the block level using
	a triangulation technique or the support vector machine (SVM) classifier,
	and the upper layer accurately estimates the tag's location using
	the conventional particle filter within the pre-computed or classified
	block. This layered structure improves the location estimation and
	the tracking performance, because the location evidence from the
	lower layer effectively restricts the range of possible locations
	of the upper layer. We implement the proposed location tracking method
	using a ubiquitous RFID wireless network in an intelligent office,
	where several RFID readers are located in fixed locations and people
	or objects with active RFID tags move around the office. Extensive
	experiments show that the proposed location tracking method is so
	precise and robust that it is a good choice for person or object
	tracking in ubiquitous computing contexts. We also validate the usefulness
	of the proposed location tracking method by implementing it for a
	real-time people monitoring system in a noisy and complex steel mill.},

	limited by the conditions imposed by many real applications. For
