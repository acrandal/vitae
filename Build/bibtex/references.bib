  Abstract                 = {Summary Mark Weiser originated the term ubiquitous computing (ubicomp), creating a vision of people and smart environments augmented with computational resources that provide information and services when and where desired. What is clear from this articulation of ubicomp is that people and their activities are central to this vision and realizing the vision requires us to address a number of clear goals. First, the everyday practices of people need to be understood and supported. Second, the world needs to be augmented through the provisioning of heterogeneous devices offering different forms of interactive experience. The networked devices must be orchestrated to provide for a holistic user experience. In this chapter, we will overview how these human-centered goals have impacted research in three areas relevant to smart environments: the definition of the appropriate physical interaction experience; discovering general application features; and the evolution of theories and practices for designing and evaluating the human experience in smart environments. Though we will provide examples from many other research efforts, we will conclude this chapter with concrete examples from our own work in classrooms and the home.},

  Abstract                 = {Pervasive sensors in the home have a variety of applications including energy minimization, activity monitoring for elders, and tutors for household tasks such as cooking. Many of the common sensors today are binary, e.g. IR motion sensors, door close sensors, and floor pressure pads. Predicting user behavior is one of the key enablers for applications. While we consider smart home data here, the general problem is one of predicting discrete human actions. Drawing on Activity Theory, the language as action principle, and speech understanding research, we argue that smoothed s are very appropriate for this task. We built such a model and applied it to data gathered from 3 smart home installations. The data showed a classic Zipf or power-law distribution, similar to speech and language. We found that the predictive accuracy of the model ranges from 51% to 39%, which is significantly above the baseline for the deployments of 16, 76 and 70 sensors. While we cannot directly compare this result with other work (lack of shared data), by examination of high entropy zones in the datasets (e.g. the kitchen triangle) we argue that accuracies around 50% are best possible for this task.},

A wireless sensor network constructed from sensory agents of PIR motion detection sensors and door contact sensors is employed to collect the occupancy data from different areas in the ambient intelligent environment. Additionally, an RSSI detection capability is integrated to create wireless localizing agents along with tagging the occupant as a mobile node to distinguish him/her from other occupants or visitors. It is shown that by using a wireless sensor network of localizing agents for the occupancy detection of the tagged occupant, the redundancy and noise in the occupancy signal is reduced; hence, the efficiency of occupancy detection in different areas of the environment is increased.},

  Abstract                 = {Automated activity recognition systems that use probabilistic models require labeled data sets in training phase for learning the model parameters. The parameters are different for every person and every environment. Therefore, for every person or environment, training is needed to be performed from scratch. Obtaining labeled data requires much effort therefore poses challenges on the large scale deployment of activity recognition systems. Active learning can be a solution to this problem. It is a machine learning technique that allows the algorithm to choose the most informative data points to be annotated. Because the algorithm selects the most informative data points, the amount of the labeled data needed for training the model is reduced. In this study, we propose using active learning methods for activity recognition. We use three different informativeness measures for selecting the most informative data points and evaluate their performances using three real world data sets recorded in a home setting. We show through experiments that the required number of data points is reduced by 80% in House A, 73% in House B, and 66% in House C with active learning.},

ZigBee is a new emerging technology for low rate, low power and low range communication networks, which aims to provide long battery life for network devices. In this paper, we discuss various localisation and tracking techniques and categorise these techniques based on the communication between nodes in centralised and decentralised localisation systems. We propose a decentralised ZigBee-based tracking system to detect and track the location of mobile nodes indoors based on the received signal strength (RSS). The proposed tracking system is a range-free system, which does not require additional hardware, depends on a new weight function, and can be deployed wherever the node density is low. The tracking system is implemented by ZigBee sensor devices, and experiments are done to evaluate the proposed tracking system based on accuracy and communication cost.},

Firstly, using Bluetooth measurements the zone where the target object is located is enclosed. Afterwards, processing WiFi measurements the RSS readings are compared only against the fingerprints of the points within the previously determined zone for the precise determination of the object position. In a recent work, we approached this problem by constructing simulated Bluetooth and WLAN maps and assuming that Bluetooth measurements determine precisely the zone where the object is located. Here we present a new algorithm to cope with erroneous identification of the preselected region. The performance of this method has been tested experimentally and the comparison between the localization results obtained using both technologies and using only WiFi is presented.},

The SmartHouse project uses a system of basic sensors to monitor a person's in-home activity; a prototype of the system is being tested within a subject's home. We examined whether the system could be used to detect behavioral patterns and report the results in this paper. Mixture models were used to develop a probabilistic model of behavioral patterns. The results of the mixture-model analysis were then evaluated by using a log of events kept by the occupant.},

Bluetooth technology, being a common feature of commercial mobile devices, is a (or the) key technology that is pervasively available nowadays. There has been not much success in using Bluetooth technology for indoor localization, mainly due to the limitation of the technology. Using the Context Management Frame (CMF) infrastructure deployed in our office building, we have designed, implemented and evaluated a Bluetooth based indoor localization solution that determines the locations of stationary mobile users at a room level. The solution is based on the inquiry response rate of Bluetooth technology. This approach does not require establishing any connectivity between Bluetooth devices. Further, since the solution is infrastructure- and network-based, it does not require mobile devices to be upgraded in any way in order to be localized. The results of experiments show that our solution has 98% accuracy in rooms with full Bluetooth sensor coverage, when the target device being stationary for 3 minutes.},

We have operated the system for over a year with more than 200 users working on a variety of laptops. To encourage use, we have implemented a live map that shows user locations in real-time, allowing for quick and easy friend-finding and lost-laptop recovery abilities. Through the system's life we have collected over 8,700 training points and performed over 1,000,000 localizations. We find that the system can localize to within 10 meters in 94% of cases.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a parametric method to automatically identify people in monocular low-resolution video by estimating the height and stride parameters of their walking gait. Stride parameters (stride length and cadence) are functions of body height, weight, and gender. Previous work has demonstrated effective use of these biometrics for identification and verification of people. In this paper, we show that performance is significantly improved by using height as an additional discriminant feature. Height is estimated by robustly segmenting the person from the background and fitting their apparent height to a time-dependent model. This method is correspondence-free and works with low-resolution images of people. It is also view-invariant, albeit performance is optimal in near fronto-parallel configurations. Identification accuracy is estimated at 47% for fronto-parallel sequences of 41 people, and 65% for non-fronto-parallel sequences of 17 people, compared with 18% and 51%, respectively, when only stride and cadence are used.},

In this paper, we show that performance is significantly improved by using height as an additional discriminant feature. Height is estimated by segmenting the person from the background and fitting their apparent height to a time-dependent model. With a database of 45 people and 4 samples of each, we show that a person is correctly identified with 49% probability when using both height and stride parameters, compared with 21% when using stride parameters only. Height estimates for this configuration are accurate to within sigma;=3.5 cm. This method works with low-resolution images of people, and is robust to changes in lighting, clothing, and tracking errors.},

them into C++ (or CUDA for GPU), compiles them into dynamically

He found by patient inquiry that several measures of physical features, along with dimensions of certain bones or bony structures in the body remain fairly constant throughout adult life.

He concluded that when these measurements were made and recorded systematically every single individual would be found to be perfectly distinguishable from others. The system was soon adapted to police methods when crime fighters found value in being able to fix a person's identity. It prevented false impersonation and brought home, to any one charged with an offense, a person's responsibility for a wrongdoing. After its introduction in France in 1883 "Bertillonage," as it was called, became widely popular, and credited with producing highly gratifying results. Many countries followed suit in the adoption of the method, integrating it within their justice systems.},

Weighted Centroid Localization (WCL) provides a fast and easy
algorithm to locate devices in wireless sensor networks. The
algorithm is derived from a centroid determination which
calculates the position of devices by averaging the coordinates of
known reference points. To improve the calculated position in
real implementations, WCL uses weights to attract the estimated
position to close reference points provided that coarse distances
are available. Due to the fact that Zigbee provides the Link
Quality Indication (LQI) as a quality indicator of a received
packet, it can also be used to estimate a distance from a node to
reference points.},

However, these systems typically require a time-consuming and costly training phase to build the radio map. Moreover, since radio signals change and fluctuate over time, map maintenance requires continuous re-calibration. We introduce a new concept called asynchronous interval labeling that addresses these problems in the context of user-generated place labels. By using an accelerometer to detect whether a device is moving or stationary, the system can continuously and unobtrusively learn from all radio measurements during a stationary period, thus greatly increasing the number of available samples. Movement information also allows the system to improve the user experience by deferring labeling to a later, more suitable moment. Initial experiments with our system show considerable increases in data collected and improvements to inferred location likelihood, with negligible overhead reported by users.},

Bayesian Classifier and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are compared for learning and recognizing previously defined individual activities. These methods are evaluated on recorded data sets. A novel Hybrid Classifier is then proposed. This classifier combines generative Bayesian methods and discriminative SVMs. Bayesian methods are used to detect previously unseen activities, while the SVMs are shown to provide high discriminative power for recognizing examples of learned activity classes. The evaluation results of the Hybrid classifier for the recorded data sets show that the combination of generative and discriminative classification methods outperforms the individual methods when identifying unseen activities.},

  Abstract                 = {The emerging context-aware applications relying on the wireless networking, require the availability of network services that provide even simple notions of context as position and identity. In the last few years several localization and tracking systems for indoor environment have been proposed. However, these systems are often very expensive since they require the installation of dedicated infrastructures of sensors based on radio, ultrasound or infrared technologies, to determine the user position. This paper aims to propose and analyze a novel indoor localization and tracking system based on the Bluetooth technology. This is a short-range, low complexity and low cost wireless technology that supports explicit device discovery services. The proposed localization system fully integrates these device discovery procedures into the infrastructure-based network of Bluetooth access points that provides the wireless connectivity inside a building. This design approach guarantees a cost-effective solution for the positioning service implementation. In this paper we have extensively investigated through simulative analysis the performances of the proposed localization system, showing that it has a negligible overhead, still providing a timely update of user location.

Specifically, we identify factors that degrade overall performance and reliability with a focus on the physical layer, and we explore the degree to which reader configuration options can mitigate these factors. We use a custom software-radio based RFID monitoring system and configurable RFID readers to gather fine-grained data and assess the effects of the different factors. We find that physical layer considerations have a significant impact on reader performance, and that this is exacerbated by a lack of integration between the physical and MAC layers. We show that tuning physical layer operating parameters can increase the read rate for a set of tags by more than a third. Additionally, we show that tighter integration of the physical and MAC layers has the potential for even greater improvements.},

The problem of localization, i.e., determining where a given node is physically located in a network is a challenging one, and yet extremely crucial for many of these applications. Practical considerations such as the small size, form factor, cost and power constraints of nodes preclude the reliance on GPS (Global Positioning System) on all nodes in these networks. In this paper, we review localization techniques and evaluate the effectiveness of a very simple connectivity-metric method for localization in outdoor environments that makes use of the inherent radio-frequency (RF) communications capabilities of these devices.

  Abstract                 = {Multiagent systems are rapidly finding applications in a variety of domains, including robotics, distributed control, telecommunications, and economics. The complexity of many tasks arising in these domains makes them difficult to solve with preprogrammed agent behaviors. The agents must, instead, discover a solution on their own, using learning. A significant part of the research on multiagent learning concerns reinforcement learning techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). A central issue in the field is the formal statement of the multiagent learning goal. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of many different goals, among which two focal points can be distinguished: stability of the agents' learning dynamics, and adaptation to the changing behavior of the other agents. The MARL algorithms described in the literature aim---either explicitly or implicitly---at one of these two goals or at a combination of both, in a fully cooperative, fully competitive, or more general setting. A representative selection of these algorithms is discussed in detail in this paper, together with the specific issues that arise in each category. Additionally, the benefits and challenges of MARL are described along with some of the problem domains where the MARL techniques have been applied. Finally, an outlook for the field is provided.},

Data was acquired at a continuous rate of 29,300 spectra per second with a 98% duty cycle. Two consecutive spectra were coherently summed to improve sensitivity, resulting in an effective rate of 14,600 A-lines per second at an effective integration time of 68 �s. The turn-key source was a combination of two super luminescent diodes with a combined spectral width of more than 150 nm providing 4.5 mW of power. The spectrometer of the spectraldomain OCT (SD-OCT) setup was centered around 885 nm with a bandwidth of 145 nm. The effective bandwidth in the eye was limited to approximately 100 nm due to increased absorption of wavelengths above 920 nm in the vitreous. Comparing the performance of our ultrahighresolution SD-OCT system with a conventional high-resolution time domain OCT system, the A-line rate of the spectral-domain OCT system was 59 times higher at a 5.4 dB lower sensitivity. With use of a software based dispersion compensation scheme, coherence length broadening due to dispersion mismatch between sample and reference arms was minimized. The coherence length measured from a mirror in air was equal to 4.0 �m (n= 1). The coherence length determined from the specular reflection of the foveal umbo in vivo in a healthy human eye was equal to 3.5 �m (n = 1.38). With this new system, two layers at the location of the retinal pigmented epithelium seem to be present, as well as small features in the inner and outer plexiform layers, which are believed to be small blood vessels. ???2004 Optical Society of America.},

  Abstract                 = {WLAN location estimation based on 802.11 signal strength is becoming increasingly prevalent in today's pervasive computing applications. Among the well-established location determination approaches, probabilistic techniques show good performance and, thus, become increasingly popular. For these techniques to achieve a high level of accuracy, however, a large number of training samples are usually required for calibration, which incurs a great amount of offline manual effort. In this paper, we aim to solve the problem by reducing both the sampling time and the number of locations sampled in constructing a radio map. We propose a novel learning algorithm that builds location-estimation systems based on a small fraction of the calibration data that traditional techniques require and a collection of user traces that can be cheaply obtained. When the number of sampled locations is reduced, an interpolation method is developed to effectively patch a radio map. Extensive experiments show that our proposed methods are effective in reducing the calibration effort. In particular, unlabeled user traces can be used to compensate for the effects of reducing the calibration effort and can even improve the system performance. Consequently, manual effort can be reduced substantially while a high level of accuracy is still achieved},

  Abstract                 = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

Benefits include making aging-in-place a reality, continuous monitoring, and improved psychosocial effects. Concerns of this technology include cost, availability of technology, retrofitting complications, and potential inappropriate use of the technology.

  Abstract                 = {Rising global energy demands, increasing costs and limited natural resources mean that householders are more conscious about managing their domestic resource consumption. Yet, the question of what tools Ubicomp researchers can create for residential resource management remains open. To begin to address this omission, we present a qualitative study of 15 households and their current management practices around the water, electricity and natural gas systems in the home. We find that in-the-moment resource consumption is mostly invisible to householders and that they desire more real-time information to help them save money, keep their homes comfortable and be environmentally friendly. Designing for domestic sustainability therefore turns on improving the visibility of resource production and consumption costs as well as supporting both individuals and collectives in behavior change. Domestic sustainability also highlights the caveat of potentially creating a green divide by making resource management available only to those who can afford the technologies to support being green. Finally, we suggest that the Ubicomp community can contribute to the domestic and broader sustainability agenda by incorporating green values in designs and highlight the challenge of collecting data on being green.},

This paper describes a context-aware middleware providing an automatic home service based on a user's preference inside a smart home. The context-aware middleware includes an appliance controller, a context-aware agent and a scalable browser. The appliance controller takes charge of communication between appliances in the context-aware middleware. The context-aware middleware use OSGi (open service gateway initial) as the framework of the home network. The scalable browser recognizes the properties of all the rendering device, and it figures out their screen size. We use UlML (user interface markup language) as multiple rendering device. The context-aware agent utilizes 6 basic data values for learning and predicting the user's preference for the home appliances: the pulse, the body temperature, the facial expression, the room temperature, the time, and the location. The six data sets construct the context model and are used by the context manager module. The user profile manager maintains the history information for home appliances chosen by the user. The user-pattern learning and predicting module is based on a neural network, which predicts the proper home service for the user. The test results show that the pattern of an individual's preference can be effectively evaluated.},

In this paper, we study properties of passive UHF RFID systems such as the relationship between distance and RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indictor), performance variations among the same type of passive tags, and readabilities of tags. We propose a received signal strength based Localization Algorithm using passive UHF RFID system. The localization uses the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to estimate the physical position of the target tag. To improve the accuracy of the passive tag attached object location, the properties and characteristics are applied to the localization algorithm. According to the analysis of experimentation, our proposed approach shows over 34% improvement compared with the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm with the use of single reader and a single antenna, and 13 reference tags.},

  Abstract                 = {Perl 1.0 came out in 1987. In the decades since then, The language has gone from a simple tool for system administration somewhere between shell scripting and C programming (Perl 1) to a powerful, general purpose language steeped in a rich heritage (Perl 5) and a consistent, coherent, rethinking of programming intended to last for at least another 25 years (Perl 6).

Even so, most Perl 5 programs in the world take far too little advantage of the language. You can write Perl 5 programs as if they were Perl 4 programs (or Perl 3 or 2 or 1), but programs written to take advantage of everything amazing the worldwide Perl 5 community has invented, polished, and discovered are shorter, faster, more powerful, and easier to maintain than their alternatives.

Modern Perl is one way to describe how experienced and effective Perl 5 programmers work. They use language idioms. They take advantage of the CPAN. They're recognizably Perlish, and they show good taste and craftsmanship and a full understanding of Perl.

You can learn this too, whether you've dabbled with Perl for a decade or someone just handed you this book and said "Fix this code by Friday."},

  Abstract                 = {Most of us still think of fingerprint analysis as a kind of gold standard of criminal forensics, expressly developed as an indisputable means of catching the bad guy. Cole points out that these assumptions aren't necessarily warranted. Fingerprinting was initially utilized in British-ruled India and with Chinese immigrants in the United States simply to sort out people. Only later was it used for criminal identification and even later still as forensic evidence. For many years, it was secondary to the Bertillon system of anthropometric measurement as a method of identifying criminals. Finally, after a half-century as that forensic gold standard, it was called into question by issues of print forgery, incompetent examiners, and the methodology of latent print identification, allowing DNA typing to assume the role of a possible new forensic standard. A fascinating bit of social history but rough going for the lay reader in its technical discussions, this work by first-time author Cole is recommended for larger public and academic libraries.

  Review                   = {Cole's comprehensive first book investigates the tangled intersections of scientific identification and law enforcement, entering similar territory as Colin Beavan's Fingerprints (see review above), but with more rigorous detail and attention to historical ambiguities. Cole, with a Ph.D. in science and technology studies, describes how the anonymity of the growing cities introduced "identification as a problem without a solution" (prefigured by the 16th-century Martin Guerre case in which the suspect's identity remained in question after the conflicting testimonies of 150 of his townsmen), even as the need was developing to identify and isolate career criminals. Bertillonage, the foremost anthropometry (bodily measurement) system, was believed to be a breakthrough and persisted into the 1930s. Cole details decades of conflict and competition between Bertillon's advocates and those of the radical and haphazardly developing science of fingerprinting (which was initially envisioned for civil verification, e.g., for payrolls). Although successful prosecutions heralded the embrace of fingerprinting by the 1920s, controversy involving partial or single prints kept validity at bay. Furthermore, the lack of a single, central fingerprint database "made fingerprinting a somewhat empty promise," as did the incompatibility of competing fingerprinting systems. Political overtones surface as Cole tracks America's war on crime, beginning when J. Edgar Hoover unsuccessfully sought universal fingerprinting. Late chapters like "Fraud, Fabrication, and False Positives" address recent developments including the controversial certification process for fingerprint examiners, defense attorney attacks on examiner credibility or corruption, and what Cole portrays as the premature reliance on DNA typing and other new forms of biometric identification. Drier but more in-depth and exacting than Beavan's, this well-wrought history will be admired by scholars and serious lay readers. Photos and illus.

These frames are compared to training frames using normalized correlation, and subject classification is performed by nearest-neighbor matching among correlation scores. The approach implicitly captures biometric shape cues such as body height, width, and body-part proportions, as well as gait cues such as stride length and amount of arm swing. We evaluate the method on four databases with varying viewing angles, background conditions (indoors and outdoors), walking styles and pixels on target.},

As the population ages, the percentage of people in this group is increasing and the effects are expensive as well as unsatisfying. We hypothesize that many people with disabilities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of at-home automated assistance and health monitoring. In order to accomplish this, robust methods must be developed to collect relevant data and process it dynamically and adaptively to detect and/or predict threatening long-term trends or immediate crises. The main objective of this paper is to investigate techniques for using agent-based smart home technologies to provide this at-home health monitoring and assistance. To this end, we have developed novel inhabitant modeling and automation algorithms that provide remote health monitoring for caregivers. Specifically, we address the following technological challenges: 1) identifying lifestyle trends, 2) detecting anomalies in current data, and 3) designing a reminder assistance system. Our solution approaches are being tested in simulation and with volunteers at the UTA's MavHome site, an agent-based smart home project.},

As a critical part of this technology, our objective is to design software algorithms that recognize and assess the consistency of activities of daily living that individuals perform in their own homes. Methods: We have designed algorithms that automatically learn Markov models for each class of activity. These models are used to recognize activities that are performed in a smart home and to identify errors and inconsistencies in the performed activity. Results: We validate our approach using data collected from 60 volunteers who performed a series of activities in our smart apartment testbed. The results indicate that the algorithms correctly label the activities and successfully assess the completeness and consistency of the performed task. Conclusions: Our results indicate that activity recognition and assessment can be automated using machine learning algorithms and smart home technology. These algorithms will be useful for automating remote health monitoring and interventions.},

  Abstract                 = {Most of the track fusion work documented in the literature involves a post-processing, batch approach to track-to-track association. Also, it is generally assumed that, due to bandwidth constraints, sensor contacts are unavailable to the track fusion system. Our work differs in that we develop a real-time, recursive approach to the track fusion problem. Further, our algorithm was developed for a centralized architecture, so that sensor data is available to the track fuser, allowing for improved track fusion performance. While the algorithm can be readily modified to operate in decentralized settings when bandwidth constraints are such that sensor contacts are unavailable to the track fuser, our work motivates a hierarchical, multi-stage approach to data fusion even in centralized settings. This is particularly useful when sensor revisit rates vary greatly.

Our track fusion algorithm uses an efficient linear programming-based approach to data association and a customized version of the interacting multiple model (IMM) filter with precise calculations for model transition probabilities and for model-to-model filter predictions. Data association is based on kinematic as well as classification information. We present results based on ground target scenarios with move-stop-move targets, with target contacts originating from radar data (GMTI and SAR), electro-optical imagery, signal intelligence, and acoustic and seismic unattended ground sensors (UGS).},

to know who is performing what actions. This knowledge allows
the system to accurately build individuals? histories and to take
personalized action based on the current resident. Without a good
handle on identity, multi-resident smart homes are less effective
when used for medical and assistive applications.
Most smart home systems either have a single occupancy
requirement, or rely on a wireless or video device to identify
individuals. These requirements are too burdensome in some
situations, which can limit the deployment of smart home
technologies in environments that would derive benefits from
them. This research work introduces the use of passive sensors
and a Hidden Markov Model as a means to identify individuals.
The result is a passive, low profile means to attribute individual
events to unique residents.
For this work, two different pairs of individuals living in a
smart home testbed are used to evaluate the tools. The data used
is from unscripted, full time occupancy and annotated by the
residents themselves for accuracy. Lastly, the Hidden Markov
Model approach is compared and contrasted against a prior
Naive Bayes solution on the same data sets.},

An anticipated increase in the older adult population around the world and increasing health care expenditures have increased the demand of smart health assistance systems. Delivering in-home activity interventions to residents for timely reminders ensuring successful completion of daily activities, is receiving significant attention in the community. In this chapter, the problem of automated in-home activity interventions is described and prospective solutions are compared. The approaches and challenges are based on a prototypic model of an automated prompting system, namely PUCK, which is an on-going project at the Center for Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems at Washington State University. The previous study done on this project investigated the application of machine learning techniques to identify appropriate timing of prompts based on data provided by off-the-shelf sensors. The fundamental problem in learning timing of prompts is caused due to the under representation of prompt situations in the training examples as compared to no-prompt situations. While a method was originally proposed to deal with this problem, popularly known as learning from imbalanced class distributions, in this chapter a novel Cluster-Based Under-sampling (CBU) approach is proposed that shows promising results.},

They attempt to allow users to gain control over their lives by framing the problem as one of end-user programming. But families are not users as we typically conceive them, and a large body of ethnographic research shows how their activities and routines do not map well to programming tasks. End-user programming ultimately provides control of devices. But families want more control of their lives . In this paper, we explore this disconnect. Using grounded contextual fieldwork with dual-income families, we describe the control that families want, and suggest seven design principles that will help end-user programming systems deliver that control.},

We believe that probabilistic approaches are among the most promising candidates to providing a comprehensive and real-time solution to the robot localization problem. However, current methods still face considerable hurdles. In particular the problems encountered are closely related to the type of representation used to represent probability densities over the robot's state space. Earlier work on Bayesian filtering with particle-based density representations opened up a new approach for mobile robot localization based on these principles. We introduce the Monte Carlo localization method, where we represent the probability density involved by maintaining a set of samples that are randomly drawn from it. By using a sampling-based representation we obtain a localization method that can represent arbitrary distributions. We show experimentally that the resulting method is able to efficiently localize a mobile robot without knowledge of its starting location. It is faster, more accurate and less memory-intensive than earlier grid-based methods,},

A smart home is a residence equipped with technology that enhances safety of residents and monitors their health conditions. The study aim is to assess older adults? perceptions of specific smart home technologies (i.e., a bed sensor, gait monitor, stove sensor, motion sensor, and video sensor).

Methods: The study setting is TigerPlace, a retirement community designed according to the Aging in Place model. Focus group sessions with fourteen residents were conducted to assess perceived advantages and concerns associated with specific applications, and preferences for recipients of sensor-generated information pertaining to residents? activity levels, sleep patterns and potential emergencies. Sessions were audio-taped; tapes were transcribed, and a content analysis was performed.

Results: A total of fourteen older adults over the age of 65 participated in three focus group sessions Most applications were perceived as useful, and participants would agree to their installation in their own home. Preference for specific sensors related to sensors? appearance and residents? own level of frailty and perceived need. Specific concerns about privacy were raised.

Conclusions: The findings indicate an overall positive attitude toward sensor technologies for nonobtrusive monitoring. Researchers and practitioners are called upon to address ethical and technical challenges in this emerging domain.},

Research design and methods: Three focus group sessions were conducted within this pilot study to assess older adults' perceptions of the technology and ways they believe technology can improve their daily lives. Themes discussed in these groups included participants' perceptions of the usefulness of devices and sensors in health-related issues such as preventing or detecting falls, assisting with visual or hearing impairments, improving mobility, reducing isolation, managing medications, and monitoring of physiological parameters. The audiotapes were transcribed and a content analysis was performed. 

Results: A total of 15 older adults participated in three focus group sessions. Areas where advanced technologies would benefit older adult residents included emergency help, prevention and detection of falls, monitoring of physiological parameters, etc. Concerns were expressed about the user-friendliness of the devices, lack of human response and the need for training tailored to older learners. 

Conclusions: All participants had an overall positive attitude towards devices and sensors that can be installed in their homes in order to enhance their lives.},

Such speed is especially useful in solar-powered remote sensing applications, where the board might only need to awaken once every five minutes to read a few sensors, before falling asleep again. "Even at 1.69 seconds, 99 percent of your power was spent by Linux and firmware bootup boilerplate, and not your code," Technologic spokesperson Ronald Gomes said at the time.

Now, the company has shipped a new hardware platform -- the TS-7400 -- that can boot even faster, thanks to a hardware-accelerated NAND controller and hardware ECC (error checking/correction) unit, it says. The TS-7400 is also smaller and less expensive than the earlier TS-7300, by virtue of a "system-on-module" design.},

In this paper, we propose a room localization method, based on a voting scheme, that eliminates cells close to a base station detecting devices with a weak signal.

An unsupervised, data-driven, fuzzy technique is proposed for extracting fuzzy membership functions and rules that represent the user's particularized behaviors in the environment. The user's learned behaviors can then be adapted online in a life-long mode to satisfy the different user and system objectives. We have performed unique experiments in which the intelligent agent has learned and adapted to the user's behavior, during a stay of five consecutive days in the intelligent dormitory (iDorm), which is a real ubiquitous computing environment test bed. Both offline and online experimental results are presented comparing the performance of our technique with other approaches. The results show that our proposed system has outperformed the other approaches, while operating online in a life-long mode to realize the ambient intelligence vision.},

  Abstract                 = {A tracklet is the estimate of a target state or track that is equivalent to an estimate based only a few measurements. Typically, tracklets are considered to reduce the communications costs between sensors and remote global or fusion trackers. The literature includes several methods for computing tracklets. Some of the methods compute tracklets from measurements, while others compute tracklets from the sensor-level tracks. Some of the methods ignore or omit process noise from the modeling, while others methods attempt to address the presence of process noise. The tracking of maneuvering targets requires the inclusion of process noise. When a tracklet that was developed for nonmaneuvering targets (i.e., no process noise) is used for tracking maneuvering targets, the errors of the tracklet will be somewhat cross-correlated with data from other sensors for the same target, and it is referred to as a quasi-tracklet. Due to some important practical considerations, the impact of maneuvering targets on the performance of tracklets has not been thoroughly addressed in the literature. An investigation that includes the critical practical considerations requires computer simulations with realistic target maneuvers and pertinent evaluation criteria (i.e., computation of errors). In this paper, some of the practical issues concerning the use of tracklets for tracking maneuvering targets are discussed, and the results from a simulation study of the impact of target maneuvers on tracking with tracklets are given. The study considered a fusion tracker receiving tracklets from multiple sensors at dispersed locations and targets maneuvering with either random accelerations or deterministic maneuvers. Tracklets from measurements and tracklets from tracks were studied. Since process noise was added to sensor and fusion trackers to account for target maneuvers, the tracklet methods studied are technically quasi-tracklets. A novel technique is used to compare the performance of tracklets for targets maneuvering randomly with that for targets performing deterministic maneuvers.},

  Abstract                 = {In the past few years the field of pervasive computing has expanded and infiltrated down to everyday consumer activities. Smartness of devices is constantly increasing. Smart products are widespread, not just limited to appliances and electronics. With the availability of such products, there becomes an increased need for scalable smart environments that are capable of integrating them to harness their combined benefits. Sensing a space to find out about its devices and opportunities they offer is a particularly important capability in smart spaces. For example, it is very useful to be able to discover the location of a certain device, reason about its role and possible participation in a certain application, and finally be able to control it remotely. Such self sensing and delegation of control is needed by many applications like remotely pinpointing the location of a certain device that is causing some kind of threat. Self sensing requires world modeling when physical world entities are mapped into model artifacts. In this dissertation, we introduce three approaches to creating useful world models. First, we present SensoBot, a mobile sensor platform that has the ability of mapping the space, creating the respective floor plan, locating important landmarks, and approximately locating furniture. In addition, we discuss the implementation of smart plugs, a novel way to locate and control smart devices within a real smart house.

We then propose a novel approach in which classical computer vision algorithms are empowered by opportunities presented by the pervasive space. Our approach, which we call PerVision, extends classical object recognition and tracking algorithms by adding a self-assessment/adjustment loop in which sensors and actuators of the pervasive space are used to vary scene parameters to minimize errors in the recognition process. We present the PerVision concept and algorithms in the context of locating and tracking dumb objects such as furniture in a smart house. Collectively, SensoBot, Smart Plugs, and PerVision take us a few steps closer to realizing the ambitious vision of completely self sensing spaces.},

We show that although a broad spectrum of algorithms can trade accuracy for precision, none has a significant advantage in localization performance. We found that using commodity 802.11 technology over a range of algorithms, approaches and environments, one can expect a median localization error of 10 ft and 97th percentile of 30 ft. We present strong evidence that these limitations are fundamental and that they are unlikely to transcend without a fundamentally more complex environmental models or additional localization infrastructure.},

  Abstract                 = {Pervasive computing research has highlighted a need for location systems and input devices that are easy to deploy ubiquitously, are inexpensive, reliable, and practically invisible. This paper describes a novel tracking platform that attempts to meet all of these goals. The system exploits the static charge that naturally accumulates with movement through typical environments to create an inexpensive system that has potential both as a passive location system and as an input device. We demonstrate the physical principles, develop hardware and software to reliably detect interactions, and extensively evaluate a prototype implementation. We find the prototype to have a low false negative rate and a zero false positive rate. The power draw lies in the milliwatt-range and the cost per room is significantly lower than comparable systems},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents Kinect Monte Carlo Lo-
calization (KMCL), a new method for localization in three
dimensional indoor environments using RGB-D cameras, such
as the Microsoft Kinect. The approach makes use of a low
fidelity a priori 3-D model of the area of operation composed
of large planar segments, such as walls and ceilings, which are
assumed to remain static. Using this map as input, the KMCL
algorithm employs feature-based visual odometry as the particle
propagation mechanism and utilizes the 3-D map and the
underlying sensor image formation model to efficiently generate
simulated RGB-D camera views at the location of particle poses,
using a graphical processing unit (GPU). The generated 3D
views of the scene are then used to evaluate the likelihood of
the particle poses. This GPU implementation provides a factor
of ten speedup over a pure distance-based method, yet provides
comparable accuracy. Experimental results are presented for
five different configurations, including: (1) a robotic wheelchair,
(2) a sensor mounted on a person, (3) an Ascending Technologies
quadrotor, (4) a Willow Garage PR2, and (5) an RWI B21.
The results demonstrate that the system can perform robust
localization with 3D information for motions as fast as 1.5
meters per second. The approach is designed to be applicable
not just for robotics but other applications such as wearable
computing.},

Product Description
The housing problems of older people in our society are highly topical because of the growing number of retired people in the population and, especially, the yet-to-come increasing number of "very old" people. Government policies on the care of older people have been forthcoming from Whitehall, but the issue of housing is just beginning to be seriously addressed. This book represents an attempt at bringing together people from the worlds of architecture, social science and housing studies to look at the future of living environments for an ageing society. Projecting thinking into the future, it asks critical questions and attempts to provide some of the answers. It moves beyond the issues of accommodation and care to look at the wider picture of how housing can reflect the social inclusion of people as they age. "Inclusive housing in an ageing society" should appeal to a wide audience - housing, health and social care workers including: housing officers, architects, planners and designers, community regeneration workers, care managers, social workers and social care assistants, registered managers and housing providers, health improvement staff and, of course, current and future generations of older people.},

  Abstract                 = {The home deployment of sensor-based systems offers many opportunities, particularly in the area of using sensor-based systems to support aging in place by monitoring an elder's activities of daily living. But existing approaches to home activity recognition are typically expensive, difficult to install, or intrude into the living space. This paper considers the feasibility of a new approach that "reaches into the home" via the existing infrastructure. Specifically, we deploy a small number of low-cost sensors at critical locations in a home's water distribution infrastructure. Based on water usage patterns, we can then infer activities in the home. To examine the feasibility of this approach, we deployed real sensors into a real home for six weeks. Among other findings, we show that a model built on microphone-based sensors that are placed away from systematic noise sources can identify 100% of clothes washer usage, 95% of dishwasher usage, 94% of showers, 88% of toilet flushes, 73% of bathroom sink activity lasting ten seconds or longer, and 81% of kitchen sink activity lasting ten seconds or longer. While there are clear limits to what activities can be detected when analyzing water usage, our new approach represents a sweet spot in the tradeoff between what information is collected at what cost.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the logic of a microprocessor-controlled thermostat termed [`]comfortstat' to address the needs of temporary room occupants such as hotel guests while reducing energy consumption. The [`]comfortstat' design grew out of a study of thermal comfort control in a luxury hotel in San Francisco, California, USA. Hotel guests frequently arrive from widely disparate climates and have high expectations of the thermal environment. Their short-term occupancy (for periods ranging from one day to several weeks) provides a unique challenge for thermal comfort control. We examined the hotel complaint log, collected detailed physical measurements of the thermal environment in typical hotel rooms, assessed the HVAC (heating, ventilating and air-conditioning) system capacity and response time, and surveyed 315 hotel guests over a five-month period. The results of this study led to the design of a thermostat control system (the [`]comfortstat') that would solve the most serious problems. The [`]comfortstat' integrates an infrared occupancy sensor, door switch, radiant temperature sensor, and control logic to optimize room conditions while [`]learning' about the occupant's preferred comfort zone. This paper focuses on how the joint requirements of the guests and the hotel management guided the design of the [`]comfortstat' for increased occupant satisfaction and lower energy use in the hotel. The concepts are completely generic and could be applied to the design of comfort systems for other types of short-term occupancy. We present control logic flowcharts and typical examples of the action of the hotel [`]comfortstat' in response to data received from the physical environment and/or human input.},

RFID technologies are often used into critical domains or into harsh environments. But RFID system is only based on low cost equipments which then do not allow achieving robust communications. All these points make the on-line testing of RFID systems a very complex task. Thus, this article proposes the on-line characterization of a statistical system parameter, the Read-Error-Rate, to perform the on-line detection of faulty RFID components. As an introduction to the on-line testing of RFID systems, a FMEA first describes the effects on these systems of potential defects impacting the communication part. Second, a SystemC model of the RFID system is discussed as a way to evaluate the proposed test solutions. Finally, the way the maximal Read-Error-Rate can be determined using system-level simulation is explained.},

  Abstract                 = {CarpetLAN is a novel indoor wireless(-like) broad-band networking and positioning system. It uses the floor surface and the human body as an Ethernet-cable, and weak electric fields as the transmission media. Portable and wearable devices can connect to the network while the user stands or walks on the floor; connection speed is 10Mbps. Home and office appliances can also access the network if they are just put on the floor. CarpetLAN also provides an indoor positioning function, which is urgently needed for realizing ubiquitous communication. This electric field based transmission system yields ultra-micro communication cells, so the positions of humans and appliances can be detected with about 1 meter accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the increasing use of DNA evidence and other sophisticated forensic techniques in crime solving, fingerprints still serve as an indispensable tool of modern-day criminal investigation. This fascinating book, originally published in 1892, represents the first thorough investigation of this anatomical peculiarity and its application in establishing individual identity for use in law enforcement. Sir Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin and a member of the Royal Geographical Society, had already made a reputation for himself as an explorer of Africa and the founder of the new field of eugenics when he turned his attention to the subject of fingerprints. Based upon extensive research at his "anthropometric laboratory," Galton lays out an elementary system of classifying fingerprints based on observed patterns of arches, loops, and whorls. Based on his own meticulous drawings as well as photographs of ink prints, he shows that "the numerous bifurcations, origins, islands, and enclosures in the ridges that compose the pattern, are proved to be almost beyond change." Thus, he established a sure method of individual identification. Galton?s system was later modified by Sir Edward R. Henry, who became chief of police in London. In 1901, Scotland Yard officially adopted the Galton-Henry system of fingerprinting. Today, it is the most widely used system of fingerprint classification in the world. This classic work will make a welcome addition to the libraries of historians, criminologists, and fans of true crime and forensic science.},

developed a system that captures the user interaction via a pointing device, and uses this behavioural information
to verify the identity of an individual. Using statistical pattern recognition techniques, we developed a sequential
classifier that processes user interaction, according to which the user identity is considered genuine if a predefined
accuracy level is achieved, and the user is classified as an impostor otherwise. Two statistical models for the
features were tested, namely Parzen density estimation and a unimodal distribution. The system was tested
with different numbers of users in order to evaluate the scalability of the proposal . Experimental results show
that the normal user interaction with the computer via a pointing device entails behavioural information with
discriminating power, that can be explored for identity authentication.},

The scenario envisaged was the use of a medical stent implemented into the body, which monitors automatically the health status and which is able to remotely communicate with the doctor. Participants were asked to evaluate the pros and cons of the usage of this technology, their acceptance motives and potential utilization barriers. In order to understand the complex nature of acceptance, personal variables (age, technical expertise, health status), individual?s cognitive concepts toward ageing as well as perceived usefulness were related. Outcomes show that trust, believe in the reliability of technology, privacy and security as well as intimacy facets are essential for acceptance and should be considered in order to proactively design a successful rollout of smart home technologies.},

TigerPlace, a retirement community of residents assisting aging in place, has been equipped with different types of sensors with the potential of monitoring, identifying, and predicting deteriorating health conditions. Currently, the seniors' medical records and telemedicine data are stored in separate systems. Date- and time-stamped sensor data are stored in SQL databases and are not linked with the senior's personal health records. The systems related to health care data and daily activities are separately stored and do not communicate with each other. Using a human-centered design and evaluation framework, we conducted user, task, function, and representation analyses, which provide an in-depth description of user characteristics, preferences, systems functionality, basic tasks, and effective representations in such an information-distributed setting. In this article, we report our investigation of such an aging in place setting and present our preliminary results of analyses on design requirements and a couple of human-centered prototypes aiming at an integrated health data display. The project was proposed to design a holistic and comprehensive view of senior residents' health data that are currently available in disparate systems. The integrated health data display must be human-centered and should inform senior residents and health care providers in a timely manner to support decision making. This design demonstrates our effort to prototype a human-centered user interface for enhancing aging in place.},

  Abstract                 = {Wilderness Search and Rescue (WiSAR) entails searching over large regions in often rugged remote areas. Because of the large regions and potentially limited mobility of ground searchers, WiSAR is an ideal application for using small (human-packable) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide aerial imagery of the search region. This paper presents a brief analysis of the WiSAR problem with emphasis on practical aspects of visual-based aerial search. As part of this analysis, we present and analyze a generalized contour search algorithm, and relate this search to existing coverage searches. Extending beyond laboratory analysis, lessons from field trials with search and rescue personnel indicated the immediate need to improve two aspects of UAV-enabled search: How video information is presented to searchers and how UAV technology is integrated into existing WiSAR teams. In response to the first need, three computer vision algorithms for improving video display presentation are compared; results indicate that constructing temporally localized image mosaics is more useful than stabilizing video imagery. In response to the second need, a goal-directed task analysis of the WiSAR domain was conducted and combined with field observations to identify operational paradigms and field tactics for coordinating the UAV operator, the payload operator, the mission manager, and ground searchers. � 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {Smart home is expected to offer various intelligent services by recognizing residents along with their life style and feelings. One of the key issues for realizing the smart home is how to detect the locations of residents. Currently, the research effort is focused on two approaches: terminal-based and non-terminal-based method. The terminal-based method employs a type of device that should be carried by the resident while the non-terminal-based method requires no such device. This paper presents a novel non-terminal-based approach using an array of pyroelectric infrared sensors (PIR sensors) that can detect residents. The feasibility of the system is evaluated experimentally on a test bed},

  Abstract                 = {We demonstrate a system built using probabilistic techniques that allows for remarkably accurate localization across our entire office building using nothing more than the built-in signal intensity meter supplied by standard 802.11 cards. While prior systems have required significant investments of human labor to build a detailed signal map, we can train our system by spending less than one minute per office or region, walking around with a laptop and recording the observed signal intensities of our building's unmodified base stations. We actually collected over two minutes of data per office or region, about 28 man-hours of effort. Using less than half of this data to train the localizer, we can localize a user to the precise, correct location in over 95% of our attempts, across the entire building. Even in the most pathological cases, we almost never localize a user any more distant than to the neighboring office. A user can obtain this level of accuracy with only two or three signal intensity measurements, allowing for a high frame rate of localization results. Furthermore, with a brief calibration period, our system can be adapted to work with previously unknown user hardware. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our system against a variety of untrained time-varying phenomena, including the presence or absence of people in the building across the day. Our system is sufficiently robust to enable a variety of location-aware applications without requiring special-purpose hardware or complicated training and calibration procedures.},

The position of a mobile wireless transmitter is determined by the identity of the receivers within the network. Increasing the density of receivers allows the transmitter power to be reduced and the granularity of location to be refined. Location boundaries become well-defined if the wavelength is such that transmissions do not pass through walls. This property is exploited in the ORL infra-red network. 1.1 Room scale location},

In most modern video games, the set of content shipped with the game is static and unchanging, or at best, randomized within a narrow set of parameters. However, ideally, if game content could be constantly renewed, players would remain engaged longer in the evolving stream of novel content. To realize this ambition, this paper introduces the content-generating neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (cgNEAT) algorithm, which automatically evolves game content based on player preferences, as the game is played. To demonstrate this approach, the galactic arms race (GAR) video game is also introduced. In GAR, players pilot space ships and fight enemies to acquire unique particle system weapons that are evolved by the game. As shown in this paper, players can discover a wide variety of content that is not only novel, but also based on and extended from previous content that they preferred in the past. The implication is that it is now possible to create games that generate their own content to satisfy players, potentially significantly reducing the cost of content creation and increasing the replay value of games.},

We evaluated the use of passive infrared (PIR) sensors for measuring walking speed in the home on an ongoing basis. In comparisons with gait mat estimates (ground truth) and the results of a timed walk test (the clinical gold standard) in 18 subjects, we found that the clinical measure overestimated typical walking speed, and the PIR sensor estimations of walking speed were highly correlated to actual gait speed. Examination of in-home walking patterns from more than 100,000 walking speed samples for these subjects suggested that we can accurately assess walking speed in the home. We discuss the potential of this approach for continuous assessment.},

However, this knowledge discovery problem is complicated by several challenges, such as excessive noise in the data, data that does not naturally exist as transactions, a need to operate in real time, and a domain where frequency may not be the best discriminator. We propose a novel data mining technique that addresses these challenges and discovers regularly-occurring interactions with a smart home. We also discuss a case study that shows the data mining technique can improve the accuracy of two prediction algorithms, thus demonstrating multiple uses for a home automation system. Finally, we present an analysis of the algorithm and results obtained using inhabitant interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {The Pervasive Computing Laboratory at the University of Florida is dedicated to creating smart environments and assistants to enable elderly persons to live a longer and a more independent life at home. By achieving this goal, technology will increase the chances of successful aging despite an ailing health care system (e.g. Medicaid). One of the essential services required to maximize the intelligence of a smart environment is an indoor precision tracking system. Such system allows the smart home to make proactive decisions to better serve its occupants by enabling context-awareness instead of being solely reactive to their commands. This paper presents our hands-on experience and lessons learnt from our first phase work to build up a smart home infrastructure for the elderly. We review location tracking technology and describe the rationale behind our choice of the emerging ultrasonic sensor technology. We give an overview of the House of Matilda (an in-laboratory mock up house) and describe our design of a precision in-door tracking system. We also describe an OSGi-based robust framework that abstracts the ultrasonic technology into a standard service to enable the creation of tracking based applications by third party, and to facilitate the collaboration among various devices and other OSGi services. Finally, we describe three pervasive computing applications that use the location-tracking system which we have implemented in Matilda's house.},

Particle filters are simulation-based probabilistic approximations which the robotics community has shown to be effective for tracking robots? positions. This paper presents a case study of applying particle filters to location estimation for ubiquitous computing. Using trace logs from a deployed multi-sensor location system, we show that particle filters can be as accurate as common deterministic algorithms. We also present performance results showing it is practical to run particle filters on devices ranging from high-end servers to handhelds. Finally, we discuss the general advantages of using probabilistic methods in location systems for ubiquitous computing, including the ability to fuse data from different sensor types and to provide probability distributions to higher-level services and applications. Based on this case study, we conclude that particle filters are a good choice to implement location estimation for ubiquitous computing.},

Most of these methods aim to learn from a partially labeled dataset, i.e., they assume that the exact labels of some data are already known. In this paper, we propose to use a novel type of supervision information to guide the process of semisupervised learning, which indicates whether a point does not belong to a specific category. We call this kind of information negative label (NL) and propose a novel approach called NL propagation (NLP) to efficiently make use of this type of information to assist the process of semisupervised learning. Specifically, NLP assumes that nearby points should have similar class indicators. The data labels are propagated under the guidance of NL information and the geometric structure revealed by both labeled and unlabeled points, by employing some specified initialization and parameter matrices. The convergence analysis, out-of-sample extension, parameter determination, computational complexity, and relations to other approaches are presented. We also interpret the proposed approach within the framework of regularization. Promising experimental results on image, digit, spoken letter, and text classification tasks are provided to show the effectiveness of our method.},

Active RFID tags can be deployed at home to help collect daily movement data of the elderly who carries an RFID reader. When the reader detects the signals from the tags, RSSI values that represent signal strength are obtained. The RSSI values are reversely related to the distance between the tags and the reader and they are recorded following the movement of the user. The movement patterns, not the exact locations, of the user are the major concern. With the movement data (RSSI values), the clustering technique is then used to build a personalized model of normal behavior. After the model is built, any incoming datum outside the model can be viewed as abnormal and an alarm can be raised by the system. In this paper, we present the system architecture for RFID data collection and preprocessing, clustering for anomaly detection, and experimental results. The results show that this novel approach is promising.},

This paper designs a Ubiquitous Multimedia Information Delivering Service (U-MIDS) for smart home, U-MIDS can automatically deliver multimedia information, such as MP3 music, Internet radios, (Text-to-Speech) spoken online news, and personal spoken messages, to the residents according to their positions and behaviors in a smart home. Basically, the U-MIDS consists of RFID modules, embedded network media players and a U-MIDS gateway. RFID modules are used to identify the identities of home residents and which room they locate. An embedded network media player is a device broadcasting multimedia information to home residents. The U-MIDS gateway can control these network media players to play desirable spoken information, music, etc. Besides, we also integrate semantic concepts and inference rules into the U-MIDS hoping home smarter. That is, the gateway of U-MIDS can automatically provide proper multimedia services for its residents according to residents? preferences, locations, situations, etc. Through our proposed U-MIDS, the residents can be freely and easily gather the ubiquitous multimedia information upon their locations, preferences, and home intelligence all the time.},

  Abstract                 = {In traditional surveillance systems tracking of objects is achieved by means of image and video processing. The disadvantages of such surveillance systems is that if an object needs to be tracked- it has to be observed by a video camera. However, geometries of indoor spaces typically require a large number of video cameras to provide the coverage necessary for robust operation of video-based tracking algorithms. Increased number of video streams increases the computational burden on the surveillance system in order to obtain robust tracking results. In this paper we present an approach to tracking in mixed modality systems, with a variety of sensors. The system described here includes over 200 motion sensors as well as 6 moving cameras. We track individuals in the entire space and across cameras using contextual information available from the motion sensors. Motion sensors allow us to almost instantaneously find plausible tracks in a very large volume of data, ranging in months, which for traditional video search approaches could be virtually impossible. We describe a method that allows us to evaluate when the tracking system is unreliable and present the data to a human operator for disambiguation.},

  Abstract                 = {The technology available to building designers now makes it possible to monitor buildings on a very large scale. Video cameras and motion sensors are commonplace in practically every office space, and are slowly making their way into living spaces. The application of such technologies, in particular video cameras, while improving security, also violates privacy. On the other hand, motion sensors, while being privacy-conscious, typically do not provide enough information for a human operator to maintain the same degree of awareness about the space that can be achieved by using video cameras. We propose a novel approach in which we use a large number of simple motion sensors and a small set of video cameras to monitor a large office space. In our system we deployed 215 motion sensors and six video cameras to monitor the 3,000-square-meter office space occupied by 80 people for a period of about one year. The main problem in operating such systems is finding a way to present this highly multidimensional data, which includes both spatial and temporal components, to a human operator to allow browsing and searching recorded data in an efficient and intuitive way. In this paper we present our experiences and the solutions that we have developed in the course of our work on the system. We consider this work to be the first step in helping designers and managers of building systems gain access to information about occupants' behavior in the context of an entire building in a way that is only minimally intrusive to the occupants' privacy.},

  Abstract                 = {Biometrics is rapidly gaining acceptance as the technology that can meet the ever increasing need for security in critical applications. Biometric systems automatically recognize individuals based on their physiological and behavioral characteristics. Hence, the fundamental requirement of any biometric recognition system is a human trait having several desirable properties like universality, distinctiveness, permanence, collectability, acceptability, and resistance to circumvention. However, a human characteristic that possesses all these properties has not yet been identified. As a result, none of the existing biometric systems provide perfect recognition and there is a scope for improving the performance of these systems. Although characteristics like gender, ethnicity, age, height, weight and eye color are not unique and reliable, they provide some information about the user. We refer to these characteristics as ?soft ? biometric traits and argue that these traits can complement the identity information provided by the primary biometric identifiers like fingerprint and face. This paper presents the motivation for utilizing soft biometric information and analyzes how the soft biometric traits can be automatically extracted and incorporated in the decision making process of the primary biometric system. Preliminary experiments were conducted on a fingerprint database of 160 users by synthetically generating soft biometric traits like gender, ethnicity, and height based on known statistics. The results show that the use of additional soft biometric user information significantly improves ( ? 6%) the recognition performance of the fingerprint biometric system.},

We have studied the effect of the soft biometric traits on the recognition performance of unimodal face and fingerprint recognition systems and a multimodal system that uses both the primary traits. Experiments conducted on a database of 263 users show that the recognition performance of the primary biometric system can be improved significantly by making use of soft biometric information. The results also indicate that such a performance improvement can be achieved only if the soft biometric traits are complementary to the primary biometric traits.},

  Abstract                 = {Technological enhancements aid development and research in smart homes and . The temporal nature of data collected in a smart environment provides us with a better understanding of patterns that occur over time. Predicting events and detecting anomalies in such data sets is a complex and challenging task. To solve this problem, we suggest a solution using temporal relations . Our temporal pattern discovery algorithm, based on Allen?s temporal relations , has helped discover interesting patterns and relations from data sets. We hypothesize that machine learning algorithms can be designed to automatically learn models of resident behavior in a and, when these are incorporated with temporal information , the results can be used to detect anomalies. We describe a method of discovering temporal relations in data sets and applying them to perform anomaly detection on the frequently occurring events by incorporating information shared by the activity. We validate our hypothesis using empirical studies based on the data collected from real resident and virtual resident (synthetic) data.},

The body mass biometric is measured by

One feature that can be extracted from vertical ground reaction forces is body mass. This single feature has identifying power comparable to other studies that use multiple and more complex features. This study contributes to understanding the role of body mass in identification by (1) quantifying the accuracy and precision with which body mass can be obtained using vertical ground reaction forces, (2) quantifying the distribution of body mass across a population larger than has previously been studied in relation to gait analysis, and (3) quantifying the expected identification capabilities of systems using body mass as a weak biometric.

  Abstract                 = {Ubiquitous computing environments typically contain a large number and a large variety of networked sensors that are often embedded in the environment. As these networks grow in size and complexity, their management becomes increasingly costly, for instance in terms of equipment, software, and people. One way to keep these costs under control is to automate some or all of the management aspects in the system, reducing or even removing the need for human interaction. In this paper, we focus on automatically managing Bluetooth networks for indoor localization, which we consider a specific class of ubiquitous computing systems because they usually rely on many Bluetooth devices scattered throughout a particular building. We will discuss algorithms that help reducing the number of active devices needed in a network, while maintaining a comparable localization accuracy compared to the "full" network. The algorithms enable the most "valuable" Bluetooth devices in the network and will disable the others. The main advantage is that this reduces the need for network planning, which reduces the costs of operating the system. Another advantage is that it reduces the amount of energy used by the network and the mobile devices being located. We evaluate the real-world performance of our algorithms through experiments carried out with a running system in a realistic environment. We found that our algorithms can reduce a network to approximately half the original size while still retaining an accuracy level comparable to the original "full" network.},

In this paper, after introducing the existing LANDMARC system, we try to construct the relationship between RSSI and distance from Reader to Tag by experiment. Finally, an enhanced approach to reach higher accuracy of indoor localization is proposed. The proposed enhancement approach utilizes the strategy of putting the tracking tag and its k nearest reference tags in a set, then repeating to calibrate the target coordinate by the error corrections which obtained by members of this set. It is a recursive data processing approach. The calibration will continue until the tracking tag?s coordinate tend to be a stable value. Simulation and experimental comparison are also shown here to prove that the accuracy of localization is improved.},

Slowly, some of these limited term faculty positions are gaining permanent status, a recognition that they are here to stay [2].

Evaluation of our prototype, called TrackSense, indicates that such a system can deliver up to 4 cm accuracy with 3 cm precision in rooms up to five meters squared, as well as 2 degree accuracy and 1 degree precision on orientation. We explain the design and performance characteristics of our prototype and demonstrate a feasible miniaturization that supports applications that require a single device localizing itself in a space.

  Abstract                 = {Cognitive or motor function decline are major causes of loss of independent living among the aged. Several methods employing ubiquitous or unobtrusive technologies have been proposed for application toward in-home assessment to identify clinically meaningful change. Most attempts at multidimensional home monitoring have been on a limited scale. This has been the result of both technical and clinical research challenges in applying and more importantly testing the efficacy of such methods on a community-wide scale. We designed and implemented a system for application to a community based clinical trial of the efficacy of a basic sensor net (motion and contact sensors, RF location systems, and personal home computer interaction) to be studied in 300 homes of independent seniors. In this manuscript we describe a protocol to ensure several key outcomes: facilitation of recruitment and enrollment, customized training of elders for in-home computer use, optimized sensor net installation, tracking of subject status and linkage to study management software to enable on-line, real-time testing and trouble-shooting with seniors. The methodology suggests that large-scale unobtrusive in-home assessment is feasible for research needed to establish the efficacy of such systems for detection of cognitive decline and related conditions of aging.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo based particle filter that effectively deals with interacting targets, i.e., targets that are influenced by the proximity and/or behavior of other targets. Such interactions cause problems for traditional approaches to the data association problem. In response, we developed a joint tracker that includes a more sophisticated motion model to maintain the identity of targets throughout an interaction, drastically reducing tracker failures. The paper presents two main contributions: (1) we show how a Markov random field (MRF) motion prior, built on the fly at each time step, can substantially improve tracking when targets interact, and (2) we show how this can be done efficiently using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We prove that incorporating an MRF to model interactions is equivalent to adding an additional interaction factor to the importance weights in a joint particle filter. Since a joint particle filter suffers from exponential complexity in the number of tracked targets, we replace the traditional importance sampling step in the particle filter with an MCMC sampling step. The resulting filter deals efficiently and effectively with complicated interactions when targets approach each other. We present both qualitative and quantitative results to substantiate the claims made in the paper, including a large scale experiment on a video-sequence of over 10,000 frames in length.},

We present results for a social insect tracking application, where we model the domain knowledge that two targets cannot occupy the same space, and targets actively avoid collisions. We show that using this model improves track quality and efficiency. Unfortunately, the joint particle tracker we propose suffers from exponential complexity in the number of tracked targets. An approximation to the joint filter, however, consisting of multiple nearly independent particle filters can provide similar track quality at substantially lower computational cost.},

Non-intrusively measured PATs were compared with PATs measured by the standard method, and the results showed a good correlation. An equation was used to estimate blood pressure from the measured PAT during a training period for each individual. Estimated blood pressures were compared with measured blood pressures in a series of blood pressure varying experiments. For each individual, the estimated blood pressure was similar to the measured blood pressure within a tolerable error range. This method was also practiced for long-term monitoring, and the results show the value of this method for continuous home monitoring of blood pressure.},

While prior systems show limited accuracy due to blocking effects

  Abstract                 = {The increasing use of RFID tags in many applications have brought forth valid concerns of privacy and anonymity among users. One of the primary concerns with RFID tags is their ability to track an individually tagged entity. While this capability is currently thought to be necessary for supporting some features of RFID systems, such practice can lead to potential privacy violations. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme that enables anonymous estimation of the cardinality of a dynamic set of RFID tags, while allowing the set membership to vary in both the spatial and temporal domains. In addition, the proposed scheme can identify the dynamics of the changes in the tag set population. The main idea of the scheme is to avoid explicit identification of tags. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme is highly adaptive and can accurately estimate tag populations across many orders of magnitude, ranging from a few tens to millions of tags. The associated probing latency is also substantially lower (les 10%) than that of the schemes which require explicit tag identification. We also show that our proposed scheme performs well even in highly dynamic environments, where the tag set keeps changing rapidly.},

  Abstract                 = {Smart house installations are becoming more and more popular all over the world. They
help to improve the quality of a daily life, reduce costs and increase security.
The main goal of this project is to develop a JAVA tool for designing and simulating simple
2D model of a smart house. The tool provides the ability to design the physical boundaries
of a house, position a set of sensors inside it, and observe the operation of a house through a
set of scenarios, where human behaviour will trigger the sensors. Both sensors
infrastructure and building of scenarios are designed in a way that enables their easy
extension in the future. Program is logging its operation, giving ability to experiment with
scenarios and check their validity.
As conclusions extension possibilities are outlined, with the most important of them being
development of logic unit (programmable or adapive), governing the house operation,
making the software a real smart house simulator.},

This paper describes the design, implementation and analysis of a system for determining position inside a building from measured RF signal strengths of packets on an IEEE 802.11b wireless Ethernet network. Previous approaches to location awareness with RF signals have been severely hampered by non-linearity, noise and complex correlations due to multi-path effects, interference and absorption. The design of our system begins with the observation that determining position from complex, noisy and non-linear signals is a well-studied problem in the field of robotics. Using only off-the-shelf hardware, we achieve robust position estimation to within a meter in our experimental context and after adequate training of our system. We can also coarsely determine our orientation and can track our position as we move. By applying recent advances in probabilistic inference of position and sensor fusion from noisy signals, we show that the RF emissions from base stations as measured by off-the-shelf wireless Ethernet cards are sufficiently rich in information to permit a mobile device to reliably track its location.},

radio-readings taken on a location-aware device. War driving, for example,
calibrates the positions of WiFi access points using a GPS-equipped laptop. In
this paper we introduce an algorithm for self-mapping that minimizes or even
eliminates explicit calibration by allowing the location system to build this
radio map as the system is used. Using nearly 100 days of trace data, we
evaluate self-mapping?s accuracy when the map is seeded by three realistic data
sources: public war-driving databases, WiFi hotspot finders, and sporadic GPS
connectivity. On average, accuracy and coverage are shown to be comparable to
those achieved with an explicit war-driven radio map.},

Terminal mobility is one of the major pillars of applications attempting to become context-aware, and a large bandwidth enables new services such as multimedia contents streaming towards mobile terminals. Being context-aware and able to provide services in a mobile environment requires the knowledge of spatial and temporal data about the terminal. The key phase in the achievement of mobility management is the positioning process. We propose a layered positioning system based on a model combining a reference point-based approach with a trilateration-based one. Several layers of refinement are offered based on the knowledge of the topology and devices deployed. The more data are known, the better adapted to its area the positioning system can be.},

We tested the activity recognition system using over 12 hours of wearable-sensor data collected by volunteers in natural unconstrained environments. The models succeeded in identifying a small set of maximally informative features, and were able identify ten different human activities with an accuracy of 95%.},

technique estimates time-varying device locations on a spa-

streets and whose indoor edges represent hallways, staircases,
elevators, etc. Use of a hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning a signal strength sensor model allows us not only to
achieve higher accuracy than existing approaches, but to over-
come many of their limitations. In particular, our technique
is able to (1) seamlessly integrate new access points into the
model, (2) make use of negative information (not detecting an
access point), and (3) bootstrap a sensor model from sparse
training data. Experiments demonstrate various properties of
our system.},

A hybrid loss function is used in this algorithm because the association of tracklet is formulated as a joint problem of ranking and classification: the ranking part aims to rank correct tracklet associations higher than other alternatives; the classification part is responsible to reject wrong associations when no further association should be done. Experiments are carried out by tracking pedestrians in challenging datasets. We compare our approach with state-of-the-art algorithms to show its improvement in terms of tracking accuracy.},

For this purpose, and as part of Integrated Project Netcarity, far-field microphones and cameras have been installed inside an apartment and used to collect a corpus of ADLs, acted by multiple subjects. The resulting data streams are processed to generate perception-based acoustic features, as well as human location coordinates that are employed as visual features. The extracted features are then presented to Gaussian mixture models for their classification into a set of predefined ADLs. Our experimental results show that both acoustic and visual features are useful in ADL classification, but performance of the latter deteriorates when subject tracking becomes inaccurate.

  Abstract                 = {One of the key issues of emerging mobile computing and robotics is to obtain knowledge of the position of persons, vehicles and objects in an indoor environment. In order to enable a pervasive coverage, this must be achieved at low cost. Due to the importance of this problem, numerous solutions have been proposed. In this thesis two important localization techniques are discussed and major improvements are developed to address their weaknesses. A common approach for the position estimation problem is hyperbolic localization. This method is based on time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements of signals transmitted from the mobile unit, i.e. the unit that is to be located, to a set of fixed reference units. A key requirement of this technique is that the clocks of the reference devices are synchronized. Unfortunately, if electromagnetic signals are used that travel at the speed of light even a very small clock deviation results in a tremendous inaccuracy of the computed location. Therefore, a highly precise time measurement and synchronization is mandatory for these systems. However, clocks operating at the required resolution and precision are complex and thus expensive. In this thesis, a localization approach based on TDOA measurements that implies clock synchronization is proposed and discussed. It allows for the usage of low cost oscillators that operate at a moderate frequency in the order of 100 MHz. The impact of short and long term instabilities like jitter or clock drift are inherently delimited. The approach can be applied to radio or infrared as well as ultrasound based systems. The main advantage of this approach is that common synchronization mechanisms that require a significant amount of processing and/or hardware resources can be neglected. Hence, this method is well suited for applications where the mobile unit must be very low cost and thus, of low complexity. An alternative to hyperbolic localization is triangulation, which requires the measurement of angles among fixed reference units and the mobile target. In this work, an infrared detector array for angle of arrival measurement is presented. The array consists of multiple sensing elements that are orientated in different directions. First, the arrangement is described by a sampling system. However, it is shown that low cost integrated receivers yield various aberrations, and thus the sampling approach fails. Subsequently, a new approach named virtual filter interpolation is proposed and discussed. This approach can handle individual sensitivity characteristics of each sensor element and therefore outperforms the sampling approach. The proposed technique is qualified for extremely low cost localization, e.g. for robot navigation.},

  Abstract                 = {Most of the track fusion work documented in the literature involves a post-processing, batch approach to track-to-track association. Also, it is generally assumed that, due to bandwidth constraints, sensor contacts are unavailable to the track fusion system. Our work differs in that we develop a real-time, recursive approach to the track fusion problem. Further, our algorithm was developed for a centralized architecture, so that sensor data is available to the track fuser, allowing for improved track fusion performance. While the algorithm can be readily modified to operate in decentralized settings when bandwidth constraints are such that sensor contacts are unavailable to the track fuser, our work motivates a hierarchical, multi-stage approach to data fusion even in centralized settings. This is particularly useful when sensor revisit rates vary greatly.

Our track fusion algorithm uses an efficient linear programming-based approach to data association and a customized version of the interacting multiple model (IMM) filter with precise calculations for model transition probabilities and for model-to-model filter predictions. Data association is based on kinematic as well as classification information. We present results based on ground target scenarios with move-stop-move targets, with target contacts originating from radar data (GMTI and SAR), electro-optical imagery, signal intelligence, and acoustic and seismic unattended ground sensors (UGS).},

Our aim was to compare different sensor modalities on data that approached "real world" conditions, where the subject and annotator were unaffiliated with the authors. We found that 10 infra-red motion detectors outperformed the other sensors on many of the activities studied, especially those that were typically performed in the same location. However, several activities, in particular "eating" and "reading" were difficult to detect, and we lacked data to study many fine-grained activities. We characterize a number of issues important for designing activity detection systems that may not have been as evident in prior work when data was collected under more controlled conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a robust, decentralized approach to RF-based location tracking. Our system, called MoteTrack, is based on low-power radio transceivers coupled with a modest amount of computation and storage capabilities. MoteTrack does not rely upon any back-end server or network infrastructure: the location of each mobile node is computed using a received radio signal strength signature from numerous beacon nodes to a database of signatures that is replicated across the beacon nodes themselves. This design allows the system to function despite significant failures of the radio beacon infrastructure. In our deployment of MoteTrack, consisting of 23 beacon nodes distributed across our Computer Science building, we achieve a 50th percentile and 80th percentile location-tracking accuracy of 0.9 and 1.6�m respectively. In addition, MoteTrack can tolerate the failure of up to 60% of the beacon nodes without severely degrading accuracy, making the system suitable for deployment in highly volatile conditions. We present a detailed analysis of MoteTrack?s performance under a wide range of conditions, including variance in the number of obstructions, beacon node failure, radio signature perturbations, receiver sensitivity, and beacon node density.},

Different ways of visualizing large sensor data sets and representing them in a format suitable for clustering the abnormalities are also investigated. In the latter part of this paper, recurrent neural networks are used to predict the future values of the activities for each sensor.

interleaved activities along with corresponding location-related
contexts. With observations from a variety of multi-modal and
non-intrusive wireless sensors, the approach utilizes a Bayesian
Network fusion engine with inputs from a set of the most
informative features extracted from the sensors and applies
joint inference to improve the accuracy and consistency of
activity and location estimates. Additionally, each feature has to
reckon its corresponding reliability factor to control its
contribution in case of possible device failure, therefore making
the system more tolerant to inevitable disturbance commonly
encountered in a cluttered home environment. This mechanism
can cope with some inherent sensor limitations and noise
interference, thus improving overall robustness and
performance. All experiments were conducted in an

effectiveness of the system.},

Both of wireless transmission model and pyroelectric sensor monitoring system can provide the rough information of residents' location respectively. These data can be further improved by reducing the sensory uncertainty through covariance intersection (CI) data fusion method.

  Abstract                 = {It is expected that at least 40 percent of the population over 75 will need extensive health care services late in their lives. The public has a negative view of nursing home placement that has, to some extent, been confirmed by research finding that the health of a frail older person deteriorates each time he or she is moved. The Aging in Place model of care for the elderly offers care coordination (case management) and health care services to older adults so they will not have to move from one level of care delivery to another as their health care needs increase. University Nurses Senior Care (UNSC) is the service entity of this project and provides as its core service care coordination with a variety of service options. These options include care packages or services at an hourly rate to meet individual client needs. The Aging in Place project will be evaluated by comparing project clients to residents of similar acuity in nursing homes and to similar clients receiving standard community support services. Data from this project will be important to consumers, researchers, providers, insurers, and policy makers.},

When users touch ubiquitous computers with their wearable key, the keyholes of the ubiquitous computers recognize their IDs and can personalize the computers.

  Abstract                 = {We present an abstract framework for ?smart indoor environments? that are monitored unobtrusively by biometrics capture devices, such as video cameras, microphones, etc. Our interest is in developing smart environments that keep track of their occupants and are capable of answering questions about the whereabouts of the occupants. We abstract the smart environment by a state transition system: Each state records a set of individuals who are present in various zones of the environment. Since biometric recognition is inexact, state information is probabilistic in nature. An event abstracts a biometric recognition step, and the transition function abstracts the reasoning necessary to effect state transitions. In this manner, we are able to accommodate different types of biometric sensors and also different criteria for state transitions. We define the notions of ?precision? and ?recall? of a smart environment in terms of how well it is capable of identifying occupants. We have developed a prototype smart environment based upon our proposed concepts, and provide experimental results in this paper. Our conclusion is that the state transition model is an effective abstraction of a smart environment and serves as a basis for integrating various recognition and reasoning capabilities.},

The sensor itself uses a simple design inspired by computer keyboards and is made from low cost, off the shelf materials. Application of the sensor floor to a small database of 15 individuals was performed. Three features were extracted : stride length, stride cadence, and time on toe to time on heel ratio. Two of these measures have been used in video based gait recognition while the third is new to this analysis. These features proved sufficient to achieve an 80% recognition rate.},

This brief, accessible introduction describes some of the most interesting research in the field and also enables readers to implement and experiment with genetic algorithms on their own. It focuses in depth on a small set of important and interesting topics -- particularly in machine learning, scientific modeling, and artificial life -- and reviews a broad span of research, including the work of Mitchell and her colleagues.The descriptions of applications and modeling projects stretch beyond the strict boundaries of computer science to include dynamical systems theory, game theory, molecular biology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and population genetics, underscoring the exciting "general purpose" nature of genetic algorithms as search methods that can be employed across disciplines.An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms is accessible to students and researchers in any scientific discipline. It includes many thought and computer exercises that build on and reinforce the reader's understanding of the text.The first chapter introduces genetic algorithms and their terminology and describes two provocative applications in detail. The second and third chapters look at the use of genetic algorithms in machine learning (computer programs, data analysis and prediction, neural networks) and in scientific models (interactions among learning, evolution, and culture; sexual selection; ecosystems; evolutionary activity). Several approaches to the theory of genetic algorithms are discussed in depth in the fourth chapter. The fifth chapter takes up implementation, and the last chapter poses some currently unanswered questions and surveys prospects for the future of evolutionary computation.},

The anxiety framework is a scalable, real-time approach that is able to incorporate data from a number of sources, or agents, and able to accommodate interleaving event sequences. In addition to using simple sensors, we introduce a method for using audio as a pervasive sensor indicating the presence of an activity. The audio data enabled the detection of activity when interactions between a user and a monitored device didn't occur, successfully preventing false hazardous situations from being detected. We present results for a number of activity sequences, both normal and abnormal.},

We describe an alternative approach t in which the goal is for the home to essentially program itself by observing the lifestyle and desires of the inhabitants, and learning to antic- ipate and accommodate their needs. The system we have developed controls basic residential comfort systemsair heating, lighting, ventilation, and water heating.

Simply structured floor sensors are low-cost and can track people in a wide area. However, the sensor reading is discrete and missing; therefore, footsteps do not represent the precise location of a person. A Markov chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) is a promising tracking algorithm for these kinds of signals. We applied two prediction models to the MCMC: a linear Gaussian model and a highly nonlinear bipedal model. The Gaussian model was efficient in terms of computational cost while the bipedal model discriminated people more accurate than the Gaussian model. The Gaussian model can be used to track a number of people, and the bipedal model can be used in situations where more accurate tracking is required.},

The convergence of television and the Internet is lagging behind expectations, and the combination of desktop computers, entertainment consoles, televisions, and cell phones has yet to form a cohesive whole. One possible reason for this lag in progress is that these technologies don't address a coherent need -they merely augment current entertainment and communication practices. We base our research on the premise that the next revolution of technology in the home will arise from devices that help older adults maintain their independence. A coherent suite of technologies will eventually let older adults be proactive about their own healthcare, will aid them in daily activities and help them learn new skills, will create new avenues for social communication, and will help ensure their safety and well being. The Aware Home Research initiative hopes to help older adults "age in place" by creating devices that can assist with daily tasks, offer memory support, and monitor daily activities. However, understanding user needs and attitudes is essential to deploying this technology.},

  Abstract                 = {Growing convergence among mobile computing devices and embedded technology sparks the development and deployment
of ?context-aware? applications, where location is the most essential context. In this paper we present LANDMARC, a location sensing
prototype system that uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for locating objects inside buildings. The major advantage of
LANDMARC is that it improves the overall accuracy of locating objects by utilizing the concept of reference tags. Based on experimental
analysis, we demonstrate that active RFID is a viable and cost-effective candidate for indoor location sensing. Although RFID is not
designed for indoor location sensing, we point out three major features that should be added to make RFID technologies competitive in this
new and growing market.},

This paper presents the first accurate GSM indoor localization system that achieves median accuracy of 5 meters in large multi-floor buildings. The key idea that makes accurate GSM-based indoor localization possible is the use of wide signal-strength fingerprints. In addition to the 6-strongest cells traditionally used in the GSM standard, the wide fingerprint includes readings from additional cells that are strong enough to be detected, but too weak to be used for efficient communication. Experiments conducted on three multifloor buildings show that our system achieves accuracy comparable to an 802.11-based implementation, and can accurately differentiate between floors in both wooden and steel-reinforced concrete structures.},

In this article, a business-technology co-design methodology is proposed for cross-boundary integration of in-home health care devices and services. In this framework, three key elements of a solution (business model, device and service integration architecture and information system integration architecture) are organically integrated and aligned. In particular, a cooperative Health-IoT ecosystem is formulated, and information systems of all stakeholders are integrated in a cooperative health cloud as well as extended to patients' home through the in-home health care station (IHHS). Design principles of the IHHS includes the reuse of 3C platform, certification of the Health Extension, interoperability and extendibility, convenient and trusted software distribution, standardised and secured electrical health care record handling, effective service composition and efficient data fusion. These principles are applied to the design of an IHHS solution called iMedBox. Detailed device and service integration architecture and hardware and software architecture are presented and verified by an implemented prototype. The quantitative performance analysis and field trials have confirmed the feasibility of the proposed design methodology and solution.},

Some recent systems have incorporated surveying by users. Structuring localization systems "organically," however, introduces its own set of challenges: conveying uncertainty, determining when user input is actually required, and discounting erroneous and stale data. Through deployment of an organic location system in our nine-story building, which contains nearly 1,400 distinct spaces, we evaluate new algorithms for addressing these challenges. We describe the use of Voronoi regions for conveying uncertainty and reasoning about gaps in coverage, and a clustering method for identifying potentially erroneous user data. Our algorithms facilitate rapid coverage while maintaining positioning accuracy comparable to that achievable with survey-driven indoor deployments.},

To win wide consumer acceptance, these interactions must be friendly and personalized; the next generation interfaces must recognize people in their immediate environment and, at a minimum, know who they are. In this article, the authors discuss face recognition technology, how it works, problems to be overcome, current technologies, and future developments and possible applications. Twenty years ago, the problem of face recognition was considered among the most difficult in artificial intelligence and computer vision. Today, however, there are several companies that sell commercial face recognition software that is capable of high-accuracy recognition with databases of more than 1,000 people. The authors describe the face recognition technology used, explaining the algorithms for face recognition as well as novel applications, such as behavior monitoring that assesses emotions based on facial expressions},

Real-time tracking and posture discrimination enable to detect emergency situation (by trigging an alarm in case of fall detection for example) and to analyze long term activity which enforces medical follow-up. These are key-issues to improve healthcare quality for rural population. Monitoring human activity in a home environment is a challenging task in computer vision. A multi-camera system is proposed to address the complexity of home environment. Person silhouette is extracted thanks to a robust background/foreground segmentation process. A multi-view particle filter is built to track the silhouette in the scene and discriminate the person posture. This posture is used to interpret basic activities and detect falls. A finer gesture reconstruction is finally exposed which will offer a more accurate activity determination and gait analysis for future system.},

The authors designed this article to provide sufficient information to know what questions to ask when evaluating a biometric system, and to assist in determining whether performance levels meet the requirements of an application. For example, a low-performance biometric is probably sufficient for reducing-as opposed to eliminating-fraud. Likewise, completely replacing an existing security system with a biometric-based one may require a high-performance biometric system, or the required performance may be beyond what current technology can provide. Of the biometrics that give the user some control over data acquisition, voice, face, and fingerprint systems have undergone the most study and testing-and therefore occupy the bulk of this discussion.

The floor senses the changes in the pressure against its surface and produces voltage signals of the event. The test set for footstep identification includes EMFi data from 3 walkers. The testees walked casually around the floor for 30 seconds, and the steps were extracted from the data and featurized. Identification was made with discrete Hidden Markov Models. Although the research is preliminary, the results show a 78 % overall success rate of footstep identification and are hence very promising.},

It allows applications running on mobile and static nodes to learn their physical location by using listeners that hear and analyze information from beacons spread throughout the building. Cricket is the result of several design goals, including user privacy, decentralized administration, network heterogeneity, and low cost. Rather than explicitly tracking user location, Cricket helps devices learn where they are and lets them decide whom to advertise this information to; it does not rely on any centralized management or control and there is no explicit coordination between beacons; it provides information to devices regardless of their type of network connectivity; and each Cricket device is made from off-the-shelf components and costs less than U.S. $10. We describe the randomized algorithm used by beacons to transmit information, the use of concurrent radio and ultrasonic signals to infer distance, the listener inference algorithms to overcome multipath and interference, and practical beacon configuration and positioning techniques that improve accuracy. Our experience with Cricket shows that several location-dependent applications such as in-building active maps and device control can be developed with little effort or manual configuration.},

  Abstract                 = {In the context of a constantly increasing aging population with cognitive deficiencies, insuring the autonomy of the elders at home becomes a priority. The DOMUS laboratory aims to address this issue by conceiving a smart home which can both assist people and preserve their quality of life. Obviously, the ability to monitor properly the occupant's activities and thus provide the pertinent assistance depends highly on location information inside the smart home. This paper proposes a solution to localize the occupant thanks to Bayesian filtering and a set of anonymous sensors disseminated throughout the house. The localization system is designed for a single person inside the house. It could however be used in conjunction with other localization systems in case more people are present. Our solution is already functional in real conditions. The preliminary results are encouraging: location estimation exceeds 85% certainty in most cases. We conceived an experiment to estimate precisely the system's accuracy. The experiment consists of a scenario of daily routine that maximizes the occupant's motion in meaningful activities and will be performed by 30 volunteers. We conclude the paper by discussing possible continuations of this work.},

The number of sensors is often limited by physical or economical constraints and their placement is of fundamental importance to obtain accurate estimates. Unfortunately, the selection of the optimal sensor locations is intrinsically combinatorial and the available approximation algorithms are not guaranteed to generate good solutions in all cases of interest. We propose FrameSense, a greedy algorithm for the selection of optimal sensor locations. The core cost function of the algorithm is the frame potential, a scalar property of matrices that measures the orthogonality of its rows. Notably, FrameSense is the first algorithm that is near-optimal in terms of mean square error, meaning that its solution is always guaranteed to be close to the optimal one. Moreover, we show with an extensive set of numerical experiments that FrameSense achieves state-of-the-art performance while having the lowest computational cost, when compared to other greedy methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Activity recognition plays an important role in many areas such as smart environments by offering unprecedented opportunities for assisted living, automation, security and energy efficiency. It?s also an essential component for planning and plan recognition in smart environments. One challenge of activity recognition is the need for collecting and annotating huge amounts of data for each new physical setting in order to be able to carry out the conventional activity discovery and recognition algorithms. This extensive initial phase of data collection and annotation results in a prolonged installation process and excessive time investment for each new space. In this paper we propose a new method of transferring learned knowledge of activities to a new physical space in order to leverage the learning process in the new environment. Our method called ?Home to Home Transfer Learning? (HHTL) is based on using a semi EM framework and modeling activities using structural, temporal and spatial features. This method allows us to avoid the tedious task of collecting and labeling huge amounts of data in the target space, and allows for a more accelerated and more scalable deployment cycle in the real world. It also allows us to exploit the insights learned in previous spaces. To validate our algorithms, we use the data collected in several smart apartments with different physical layouts.},

A Monte Carlo Simulation technique (specifically, a Particle Filter) is employed in order to model and reduce the accumulated odometric error. Furthermore, we study the requirements to obtain an accurate yet timely pose estimate. A team of two robots is employed to explore an indoor environment in this paper, although several aspects of the approach have been extended to larger groups. The concept behind our exploration strategy has been presented previously and is based on having one robot carry a sensor that acts as a "robot tracker" to estimate the position of the other robot. By suitable use of the tracker as an appropriate motion-control mechanism we can sweep areas of free space between the stationary and the moving robot and generate an accurate graph-based description of the environment. This graph is used to guide the exploration process. Complete exploration without any overlaps is guaranteed as a result of the guidance provided by the dual graph of the spatial decomposition (triangulation) of the environment. We present experimental results from indoor experiments in our laboratory and from more complex simulated experiments.},

However, before society resigns itself to a world of constant observation and tracking, a process of moralization and ethical deliberation should occur. In this paper we examine the ethical implications of choosing camera networks or infrared motion detector networks. We employ the Dimensional Metaethics approach to help us structure examination of the complex issues involved. The analysis indicates that choice of sensor technology can powerfully affect the ethical landscape surrounding the final system. This paper also analyzes empirical results from questionnaires that asked participants to rate and choose between scenarios involving pan-tilt-zoom cameras and infrared sensors. In testing against a hypothetical even split in opinion, we find instead a significant preference for the scenario involving infrared sensors (p = 0.007). The results show that significant proportion (73%, p = 0.05) preferred a scenario with infrared sensors when compared to pan-tiltzoom cameras. Participants also report that the scenario with infrared sensors was significantly less invasive and expressed a significantly weaker preference toward situations ?Without Sensors that Collect Information About Location ? (when compared with the scenario involving pan-tiltzoom cameras). In short, we find that both dimensional metaethics and questionnaire results suggest that infrared sensors are better.},

Product Description
A voice is much more than just a string of words. Voices, unlike fingerprints, are inherently complex. Forensic Speaker Identification explains what FSI involves, and clarifies the problems of inferring identity from speech under the less than ideal conditions typical in forensics. This book has been written for forensic scientists, the legal profession and law enforcement officers. It's accessible to those with no previous knowledge of FSI, or of phonetics or acoustics. It can also be used as a base for teaching tertiary level courses in aspects of phonetics. This practical, lucid text takes the reader through all the underpinning knowledge necessary, and will bring much needed clarity to an important technique.},

  Abstract                 = {A smart home aims at building intelligence automation with a goal to provide its inhabitants with maximum possible comfort, minimize the resource consumption and thus overall cost of maintaining the home. 'Context Awareness' is perhaps the most salient feature of such an intelligent environment. Clearly, an inhabitant's mobility and activities play a significant role in defining his contexts in and around the home. Although there exists an optimal algorithm for location and activity tracking of a single inhabitant, the correlation and dependence between multiple inhabitants' contexts within the same environment make the location and activity tracking more challenging. In this paper, we first prove that the optimal location prediction across multiple inhabitants in smart homes is an NP-hard problem. Next, to capture the correlation and interactions of different inhabitants' movements (and hence activities), we develop a novel framework based on a game theoretic, Nash H-learning approach that attempts to minimize the joint location uncertainty. The framework achieves a Nash equilibrium such that no inhabitant is given preference over others. This results in more accurate prediction of contexts and better adaptive control of automated devices, leading to a mobility-aware resource (say, energy) management scheme in multi-inhabitant smart homes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of adaptively controlling a smart environment, thus reducing energy consumption and enhancing the comfort of the inhabitants.},

  Abstract                 = {The essence of pervasive (ubiquitous) computing lies in the creation of smart environments saturated with computing and communication capabilities, yet gracefully integrated with human users. 'Context Awareness' is perhaps the most important feature of such an intelligent computing paradigm. The mobility and activity of the inhabitants play significant roles in forming the context at any instance of time. In order to extract the best performance and efficacy of smart computing environments, one needs a technology-independent, context-aware platform spanning over multiple inhabitants. In this paper, we have developed a framework for mobility-aware resource (in particular, energy consumption) management in a multi-inhabitant smart home, based on a dynamic, cooperative reinforcement learning technique. The inhabitants' mobility creates uncertainty of his location and activity. Using the proposed cooperative game-theory based framework, all the inhabitants currently present in the house attempt to minimize this overall uncertainty in the form of utility functions associated with them. Joint optimization of the utility function corresponds to the convergence to Nash equilibrium and helps in accurate prediction of inhabitants' future locations and activities. This results in adaptive control of automated devices and temperature of the house, thus providing an amicable environment and sufficient comfort to the inhabitants. Simulation results point out that our framework can adaptively control the smart environment, while reducing the energy consumption and enhancing the comfort.},

A comparison of this result of the geometric method with the corresponding result obtained by dynamic satellite geodesy from Doppler data show excellent overall agreement. A combination solution that fully respects the covariance of the photogrammetrically derived directions leads to mass-centered station positions with an average positional mean error of plus or minus 3.7 m. The scale of the system, determined by several scalars measured on the earth's surface, suggests an equatorial radius for a best-fitting ellipsoid of 6.378,130 m.},

This study examined the relationship between and the cognitive correlates of self-report, performance-based, and direct observation measures commonly used as proxy measures for everyday functioning. Participants were 88 community-dwelling, cognitively healthy older adults (age 50?86 years). Participants completed standardized neuropsychological tests and questionnaires, and performed eight activities of daily living (e.g., water plants, fill a medication dispenser) while under direct observation in a campus apartment. All proxy measures of everyday function were sensitive to the effects of healthy cognitive aging. After controlling for age, cognitive predictors explained a unique amount of the variance for only the performance-based behavioral simulation measure (i.e., Revised Observed Tasks of Daily Living). The self-report instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and the performance-based everyday problem-solving test (i.e., EPT) did not correlate with each other; however, both were unique predictors of the direct observation measure. These findings suggest that neuropsychologists must be cautious in making predictions about the quality of everyday activity completion in cognitively healthy older adults from specific cognitive functions. The findings further suggest that a self-report of IADLs and the performance-based EPT may be useful measures for assessing everyday functional status in cognitively healthy older adults.

  Abstract                 = {Older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often have difficulty performing complex
instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), which are critical to independent living. In this
study, amnestic multi-domain MCI (N = 29), amnestic single-domain MCI (N = 18), and healthy
older participants (N = 47) completed eight scripted IADLs (e.g., cook oatmeal on the stove) in a
smart apartment test bed. We developed and experimented with a graded hierarchy of
technology-based prompts to investigate both the amount of prompting and type of prompts
required to assist individuals with MCI in completing the activities. When task errors occurred,
progressive levels of assistance were provided, starting with the lowest level needed to adjust
performance. Results showed that the multi-domain MCI group made more errors and required
more prompts than the single-domain MCI and healthy older adult groups. Similar to the other
two groups, the multi-domain MCI group responded well to the indirect prompts and did not
need a higher level of prompting to get back on track successfully with the tasks. Need for
prompting assistance was best predicted by verbal memory abilities in multi-domain amnestic
MCI. Participants across groups indicated that they perceived the prompting technology to be
very helpful.},

  Abstract                 = {Gait analysis is a widely used approach to detect deformations and allow clinicians to conclude possible treatments. However, accurate gait analysis require large amount of data and lengthy assessment times. Therefore this paper presents the initial study of a system which was developed with the intention to provide clinicians a solution to acquire gait parameters and detect anomalies with ease and comfort. The system consists of four force sensitive resistors and two inertial sensors to obtain ground contact force measurements and knee joint angles, respectively, during walking. Emphasis is made on the software application which was designed to be used in a clinical environment which allows users to perform gait analysis without in-depth knowledge on the software or hardware. The software application facilitates the real time acquisition of kinematic and kinetic gait parameters, intelligent gait phase detection and data storage for later reference. The designed system is a black box to the users, and the user can communicate to the hardware with the developed user-friendly GUI. The gait parameters and the gait phases detected are illustrated in a graphical and tabular form which aids to determine the presence of abnormalities, and the instance of deformation occurrences. The hardware and software was tested on several subjects, and the results obtained are discussed to verify the system.},

  Abstract                 = {Mouse dynamics has recently become an interesting new topic in the area of behavioral biometrics due to its non-intrusiveness and convenience. Some promising results have been shown by previous researches on identity authentication and monitoring using characteristics in users' mouse actions. This paper explores mouse dynamics further by focusing on an important issue not addressed previously: behavioral variability. With an empirical study of long term behaviors of 10 computer users, we show variations are obvious in mouse activities and can have a serious impact if not considered carefully. To tackle the problem of variability, we propose a dimensionality reduction based approach which is demonstrated to be effective in our experiments. More specifically, the classification results after preprocessing by PCA and ISOMAP are shown to be much better than direct classification. Moreover, the results of a false acceptance rate (FAR) 0.55% and false rejection rate (FRR) 3.00% by the nonlinear method ISOMAP are comparable to the best result reported in literature while being subject to more behavioral variability.},

In order to monitor the functional health of smart home residents, we need to design technologies that recognize and track the activities that people perform at home. Machine learning techniques can perform this task, but the software algorithms rely upon large amounts of sample data that is correctly labeled with the corresponding activity. Labeling, or annotating, sensor data with the corresponding activity can be time consuming, may require input from the smart home resident, and is often inaccurate. Therefore, in this paper we investigate four alternative mechanisms for annotating sensor data with a corresponding activity label. We evaluate the alternative methods along the dimensions of annotation time, resident burden, and accuracy using sensor data collected in a real smart apartment.},

  Abstract                 = {To address an aging population, we have been investigating sensor networks for monitoring older adults in their homes. In this paper, we report ongoing work in which passive sensor networks have been installed in 17 apartments in an aging in place eldercare facility. The network under development includes simple motion sensors, video sensors, and a bed sensor that captures sleep restlessness and pulse and respiration levels. Data collection has been ongoing for over two years in some apartments. This longevity in sensor data collection is allowing us to study the data and develop algorithms for identifying alert conditions such as falls, as well as extracting typical daily activity patterns for an individual. The goal is to capture patterns representing physical and cognitive health conditions and then recognize when activity patterns begin to deviate from the norm. In doing so, we strive to provide early detection of potential problems which may lead to serious health events if left unattended. We describe the components of the network and show examples of logged sensor data with correlated references to health events. A summary is also included on the challenges encountered and the lessons learned as a result of our experiences in monitoring aging adults in their homes.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivated by several rulings in United States courts concerning expert testimony in general and handwriting testimony in particular, we undertook a study to objectively validate the hypothesis that handwriting is individualistic. Handwriting samples of 1500 individuals, representative of the US population with respect to gender, age, ethnic groups, etc., were obtained. Analyzing differences in handwriting was done by using computer algorithms for extracting features from scanned images of handwriting. Attributes characteristic of the handwriting were obtained, e.g., line separation, slant, character shapes, etc. These attributes, which are a subset of attributes used by expert document examiners, were used to quantitatively establish individuality by using machine learning approaches. Using global attributes of handwriting and very few characters in the writing, the ability to determine the writer with a high degree of confidence was established. The work is a step towards providing scientific support for admitting handwriting evidence in court. The mathematical approach and the resulting software also have the promise of aiding the expert document examiner},

  Abstract                 = {Load balancing in electricity grids becomes a more sophisticated problem by the increased availability oftime-varying stochastic supply of electricity from conversion of renewable resources like wind orsunlight. Due to the fact that large quantities of electrical energy cannot be stored easily, demand sidemanagement by shifting electrical loads is one attempt to cope withthis problem. In this paper we discuss and compare two types of control signals to use the thermal storage of electrical household appliances as balancing power. As the system of our research consists of a high number of controllable refrigerators with independent parameters and behaviour, we investigatethe synergetic behaviour bya simulation model. For this objective we analyze a simulation model of controllable refrigerators withrespect to their ability to shift their energy demand depending on parameterized external signals. We show that both types of control signals can be used for short term reserves with delivery within 15 min of time, but they differ in possible shapes of the resulting load curves and in the reaction time of the controlled system. In addition to the simulation model we develop a model of the synergetic behaviour of an ensemble of refrigerators? reaction on control signals. This mathematical model predicts the electricity demand of ensembles of controlled appliances. As it reduces the simulation model?s complexity it could be used in a sophisticated control strategy, e.g. in a model predictive control approach. The general attempt to integrate the load shift potential of cooling devices into the control of an electricity grid can probably be transferred to other electrical appliances with thermal storage capacities.},

In order to monitor the functional health of smart home residents, we need to design technologies that recognize and track the activities that people perform at home. Machine learning techniques can perform this task, but the software algorithms rely upon large amounts of sample data that is correctly labeled with the corresponding activity. Labeling, or annotating, sensor data with the corresponding activity can be time consuming, may require input from the smart home resident, and is often inaccurate. Therefore, in this paper we investigate four alternative mechanisms for annotating sensor data with a corresponding activity label. We evaluate the alternative methods along the dimensions of annotation time, resident burden, and accuracy using sensor data collected in a real smart apartment.},

First, we show that a DBN with sparse connections in the first layer is more robust to variations that are not in the training set. Second, we develop a probabilistic denoising algorithm to determine a subset of the hidden layer nodes to unclamp. We show that this can be applied to any feedforward network classifier with localized first layer connections. Recognition results after denoising are significantly better over the standard DBN implementations for various sources of noise.},

search and real world environments, there is continuing need
for quality visualization. These data come from a variety of
sensor sources, artificial intelligence algorithms and human
feedback. Building tools that are easily configured, rapidly
developed and capable of communicating with both real time
and historical data is ever challenging.
This work introduces PyViz, a smart home-focused, middle-
ware enabled, interactive interface. PyViz is the result of several
years of testing and development in a large smart home re-
search project. During its development, issues of configuration,
ease of use and adaptability have been explored and overcome.
The demonstration of this tool hopes to enlighten the audience
about the facets of user interfaces, network agents and smart
home complexity.},

  Abstract                 = {Smart homes and ubiquitous computing tech- nologies hold great promise for a wide range of real world applications. Sensor-rich environments can pro- vide valuable insights about older adults as they go about their lives. This information is designed to help people through an aging in place approach to health care. The medical community is particularly interested in high quality measurement of activities of daily living. With accurate computer modeling of older adults, deci- sion support tools may be built to assist care providers. One aspect of effectively deploying these technologies is determining where the sensors should be placed in the home to effectively support these end goals. This work introduces and evaluates a set of ap- proaches for generating sensor layouts in the home. These approaches range from the gold standard of hu- man intuition-based placement to more advanced search algorithms, including Hill Climbing and Genetic Algo- rithms. The ultimate goal of these tools is to be run with little to no user input and output a reasonable layout of sensors. The final layout created should be ef- fective at detecting activities, while also being sensitive to total monetary cost of the layout.},

Identified themes centered around the benefits and risks of technologies, patient needs, the clinical utility of information, and specific monitoring domains that might improve the health care of older adults. Providers highlighted the primary importance of involving families and caregivers, and of sustaining human interactions. They explored the difficulties with how to use information for clinical ends, and challenged the notion that more objective information would automatically improve their heath care. Designers, developers, and researchers might improve the utility and uptake of health-related technologies for older adults and their families by eliciting the viewpoints of clinical providers.},

The algorithm uses a dynamic Bayesian network based approach to reduce the complexity of determining states.

We do this through the concept of the Use Case, which is used in software engineering to specify the behaviour of a system. We describe a set of scenarios and the possible outputs that the smart home could give and introduce the SHMUC Repository of Smart Home Use Cases.

  Abstract                 = {Americans are living longer, and research shows that seniors are embracing independence, and will benefit from living in the same place. These are the rationale for 'Aging in Place' and the development of Tiger Place, an 'Aging in Place' Environment in Columbia Missouri. Our goal is to minimize intrusion, allow the resident complete control over privacy and treatment (if any), and to provide substantive improvement in quality of life. Nevertheless there continues to be significant risks to the elderly which results in reduced functional and cognitive activity. While there has been much technology developed to ameliorate these factors, there is no comprehensive evaluation of the benefit of these devices nor a comprehensive strategy to improve the quality of life of seniors as determined by functional ability and possibly later cognitive ability. With our partners at the University of Virginia we are developing a system of sensors, to monitor the activity of seniors in their residences. We measure motion, footfalls, sleep and restlessness, we have stove sensors and sensing mats, all connected wirelessly to a computer which performs an initial evaluation and data transfer to a secure server for further study. Based upon the monitor data we will implement an intervention to ameliorate functional decline. Focus group studies determine the attitudes, concerns and impressions of the residents and staff. We find that senior's attitude to technology is healthy and they will try helpful approaches. In addition to the statistical comparisons, we model the data using hidden Markov models, integrate or fuse the monitor data with video images, and reason about behavior using fuzzy logic. The results of this work will additionally reduce the workload on caregivers, foster communication between residents and family, and give these seniors independence. We have requested and received IRB approval for this study},

This paper presents the first accurate GSM indoor localization system that achieves median within floor accuracy of 4 m in large buildings and is able to identify the floor correctly in up to 60% of the cases and is within 2 floors in up to 98% of the cases in tall multi-floor buildings. We report evaluation results of two case studies conducted over a course of several years, with data collected from 6 buildings in 3 cities across North America. The key idea that makes accurate GSM-based indoor localization possible is the use of wide signal-strength fingerprints. In addition to the 6-strongest cells traditionally used in the GSM standard, the wide fingerprint includes readings from additional cells that are strong enough to be detected, but are too weak to be used for efficient communication. We further show that selecting a subset of highly relevant channels for fingerprinting matching out of all available channels, further improves the localization accuracy.},

For all but pathological channels the bounds are asymptotically (exponentially) tight for rates aboveR_{0}, the computational cutoff rate of sequential decoding. As a function of constraint length the performance of optimal convolutional codes is shown to be superior to that of block codes of the same length, the relative improvement increasing with rate. The upper bound is obtained for a specific probabilistic nonsequential decoding algorithm which is shown to be asymptotically optimum for rates aboveR_{0}and whose performance bears certain similarities to that of sequential decoding algorithms.},

There is no reason to assume, a priori, that the sleep of an older adult is necessarily problematic; in fact, many high-functioning older adults are satisfied with their sleep. When the various factors that can disrupt sleep?poor health, primary sleep disorders, poor sleep-hygiene practices (e.g., irregular sleep schedules and poor sleeping environments), and so on?are screened out, ``optimally'' or ``successfully'' aging older adults, assuming they remain healthy, can expect to experience little further change in their sleep and are not likely to experience excessive daytime sleepiness and the concomitant need to nap regularly during the day. Nevertheless, the majority of older adults, who are not optimally aging, suffer significant sleep disturbances from a variety of causes. Fortunately, our growing understanding of how sleep changes with aging and of the causes of these changes is informing ever-improving treatments for these disturbances, thereby helping to ensure that growing older does not mean sleeping poorly.},

This technology poses many new challenges on current data management systems. RFID data are time-dependent, dynamically changing, in large volumes, and carry implicit semantics. RFID data management systems need to effectively support such large scale temporal data created by RFID applications. These systems need to have an explicit temporal data model for RFID data to support tracking and monitoring queries. In addition, they need to have an automatic method to transform the primitive observations from RFID readers into derived data used in RFID-enabled applications. In this paper, we present an integrated RFID data management system -- Siemens RFID Middleware -- based on an expressive temporal data model for RFID data. Our system enables semantic RFID data filtering and automatic data transformation based on declarative rules, provides powerful query support of RFID object tracking and monitoring, and can be adapted to different RFID-enabled applications.},

Physical biometrics, such as fingerprint and iris, have already been widely acknowledged and used in many real applications. As a relatively new technology, behavioral biometrics help verify a person's identity through some measurable activity patterns, e.g., speaker recognition (i.e., analyzing vocal behavior), signature recognition (i.e., analyzing signature dynamics), gait recognition (i.e., analyzing walking patterns), keystroke dynamics (i.e., analyzing keyboard typing patterns), mouse dynamics (i.e., analyzing mouse moving patterns), etc.},

  Abstract                 = {This lecture provides an introduction to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), a technology enabling automatic identification of objects at a distance without requiring line-of-sight. Electronic tagging can be divided into technologies that have a power source (active tags), and those that are powered by the tag interrogation signal (passive tags); the focus here is on passive tags. An overview of the principles of the technology divides passive tags into devices that use either near field or far field coupling to communicate with a tag reader. The strengths and weaknesses of the approaches are considered, along with the standards that have been put in place by ISO and EPCGlobal to promote interoperability and the ubiquitous adoption of the technology. A section of the lecture has been dedicated to the principles of reading co-located tags, as this represents a significant challenge for a technology that may one day be able to automatically identify all of the items in your shopping cart in a just few seconds. In fact, RFID applications are already quite extensive and this lecture classifies the primary uses. Some variants of modern RFID can also be integrated with sensors enabling the technology to be extended to measure parameters in the local environment, such as temperature & pressure. The uses and applications of RFID sensors are further described and classified. Later we examine important lessons surrounding the deployment of RFID for the Wal-Mart and the Metro AG store experiences, along with deployments in some more exploratory settings. Extensions of RFID that make use of read/write memory integrated with the tag are also discussed, in particular looking at novel near term opportunities. Privacy and social implications surrounding the use of RFID inspire recurring debates whenever there is discussion of large scale deployment; we examine the pros and cons of the issues and approaches for mitigating the problems. Finally, the remaining challenges of RFID are considered and we look to the future possibilities for the technology.

In order to use biosignal data monitoring systems daily at home, noninvasive monitoring and system maintenance are crucial. We propose a method of estimating the sleep stages of sleeping subjects through noninvasive measurement of heartbeat and respiration using a pneumatic method and an air mattress. However, the method incurs maintenance for periodically refilling the air of the mattress. In this paper, another pneumatic method, which uses an air tube made of the silicon rubber instead of the air mattress, is proposed. The change in S/N ratio in heartbeat and respiration signals, under greater background noise, are compared for the following: in a room with wooden flooring; in a room with tatami mats; in a bathtub; and in a lavatory.

  Abstract                 = {Home automation systems should evolve to the next phase in which they are aware of contexts, because providing services based on contexts will upgrade the service quality, thus making people more comfortable and home living more convenient. In particular, location is a piece of important and useful context information for seeking appropriate services, as well as providing them to people living in a home. So far, there have been several studies focused on tracking inhabitants in smart home environments. However, these approaches are often intrusive or require inhabitants to wear some sort of devices, which may make the inhabitants uncomfortable or even inconvenient. This problem could devastate the ultimate goal, which is to provide convenient services, and hence cause such approaches somewhat controversial. In this study, we utilize a number of load sensors together to construct a sensory floor on which exerted pressure can be detected and cover its surface with wooden flooring as in a normal home environment. Although the wooden flooring provides a flat surface for inhabitants to walk on, it also causes clutter in the sensor readings, which lead to difficulty in clearly identifying the location(s) of pressure source(s). Thus, we apply probabilistic data association technique and LeZi-Update approach to analyze the cluttered pressure readings collected by the load sensors so as to determine the positions of the inhabitants, as well as to track their movements. With our nonintrusive approach, there is no need for inhabitants to wear any devices, and this also solves the cross-walking problem in the home environment. Note to Practitioners-This system aims for detecting the location of multiple inhabitants in the home environment. We adopt the sensory floor as our tracking sensor, which consists of many blocks, each with a load cell to collect the human body weight. These blocks are covered with conventional wooden flooring to provide a flat surface on which inhabitant- s can walk freely. After collecting data, we apply mathematical techniques to analyze them, thus determining inhabitants' locations and tracking their movements. The limitation is that the system cannot differentiate different persons if they have close weight readings, which is the natural limitation of the load cell.},

When measurements from each sensor are statistically independent, the data compression method is shown to be computationally most efficient, followed by the sequential processing; the parallel processing is least efficient.},

In this paper we introduce the simultaneous tracking and activity recognition (STAR) problem, which exploits the synergy between location and activity to provide the information necessary for automatic health monitoring. Automatic health monitoring can potentially help the elderly population live safely and independently in their own homes by providing key information to caregivers. Our goal is to perform accurate tracking and activity recognition for multiple people in a home environment. We observe a ?bottom-up ? approach that primarily uses information gathered by many minimally invasive sensors commonly found in home security systems. We describe a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter for roomlevel tracking, rudimentary activity recognition (i.e., whether or not an occupant is moving), and data association. We evaluate our approach with experiments in a simulated environment and in a real instrumented home.},

We show how to handle multiple floors and stairways, how to handle symmetry in the environment, and how to initialise the localisation algorithm using WiFi signal strength to reduce initial complexity.
We evaluate the entire system experimentally, using an independent tracking system for ground truth. Our results show that we can track a user throughout a 8725 m2 building spanning three floors to within 0.5m 75% of the time, and to within 0.73 m 95% of the time.},

  Abstract                 = {Wide-area context awareness is a crucial enabling technology for next generation smart buildings and surveillance systems. It is not practical to cover an entire building with cameras, however it is difficult to infer missing information when there are significant gaps in coverage. As a solution, we advocate a class of hybrid perceptual systems that builds a comprehensive model of activity in a large space, such as a building, by merging contextual information from a dense network of ultra-lightweight sensor nodes with video from a sparse network of high-capability sensors. In this paper we explore the task of automatically recovering the relative geometry between a pan-tilt-zoom camera and a network of one-bit motion detectors. We present results for the recovery of geometry alone, and also recovery of geometry jointly with simple activity models. Because we don't believe a metric calibration is necessary, or even entirely useful for this task, we formulate and pursue the novel goal we term functional calibration. Functional calibration is the blending of geometry estimation and simple behavioral model discovery. Accordingly, results are evaluated in terms of the ability of the system to automatically foveate targets in a large, non-convex space, not in terms of pixel reconstruction error.},

We use a tracklet graph representation of the data in the sensor network, which allows us to efficiently evaluate gross patterns of office-wide social behavior of its occupants during expected seasonal changes in the workforce as well as unexpected social events that affect the entire population of the space. We present our experiments with a method based on Kullback-Leibler metric applied to the office activity modelled as a Markov process. Using this approach we detect gross deviations of short term office-wide behavior patterns from previous long-term patterns spanning various time intervals. We compare detected deviations to the company calendar and find and provide some quantitative analysis of the relative impact of those disruptions across a range of temporal scales. We also present a favorable comparison to results achieved by applying the same analysis to email logs.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensor networks hold the promise of truly intelligent buildings: buildings that adapt to the behavior of their occupants to improve productivity, efficiency, safety, and security. To be practical, such a network must be economical to manufacture, install and maintain. Similarly, the methodology must be efficient and must scale well to very large spaces. Finally, be be widely acceptable, it must be inherently privacy-sensitive. We propose to address these requirements by employing networks of passive infrared (PIR) motion detectors. PIR sensors are inexpensive, reliable, and require very little bandwidth. They also protect privacy since they are neither capable of directly identifying individuals nor of capturing identifiable imagery or audio. However, with an appropriate analysis methodology, we show that they are capable of providing useful contextual information. The methodology we propose supports scalability by adopting a hierarchical framework that splits computation into localized, distributed tasks. To support our methodology we provide theoretical justification for the method that grounds it in the action recognition literature. We also present quantitative results on a dataset that we have recorded from a 400 square meter wing of our laboratory. Specifically, we report quantitative results that show better than 90 % recognition performance for low-level activities such as walking, loitering, and turning. We also present experimental results for mid-level activities such as visiting and meeting.},

  Abstract                 = {The modern sensor technology helps us collect time series data for activities of daily living (ADLs), which in turn can be used to infer broad patterns, such as common daily routines. Most of the existing approaches either rely on a model trained by a preselected and manually labeled set of activities, or perform micro-pattern analysis with manually selected length and number of micro-patterns. Since real life ADL datasets are massive, such approaches would be too costly to apply. Thus, there is a need to formulate unsupervised methods that can be applied to different time scales.We propose a novel approach to discover clusters of daily activity routines.We use a matrix decomposition method to isolate routines and deviations to obtain two different sets of clusters. We obtain the final memberships via the cross product of these sets. We validate our approach using two real-life ADL datasets and a well-known artificial dataset. Based on average silhouette width scores, our approach can capture strong structures in the underlying data. Furthermore, results show that our approach improves on the accuracy of the baseline algorithms by 12% with a statistical significance (p < 0.05) using the Wilcoxon signed-rank comparison test.},

  Abstract                 = {A major issue of activity recognition in sensor networks is automatically recognizing a user's high-level goals accurately from low-level sensor data. Traditionally, solutions to this problem involve the use of a location-based sensor model that predicts the physical locations of a user from the sensor data. This sensor model is often trained offline, incurring a large amount of calibration effort. In this article, we address the problem using a goal-based segmentation approach, in which we automatically segment the low-level user traces that are obtained cheaply by collecting the signal sequences as a user moves in wireless environments. From the traces we discover primitive signal segments that can be used for building a probabilistic activity model to recognize goals directly. A major advantage of our algorithm is that it can reduce a significant amount of human effort in calibrating the sensor data while still achieving comparable recognition accuracy. We present our theoretical framework for activity recognition, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approach using the data collected in an indoor wireless environment.},

Our approach uses inexpensive pressure sensors, placed in a specific manner, that allows us to identify multiple people. Given this information, our algorithm can track multiple people across the floor even in the presence of large sensor error. The algorithm we develop is evaluated for a variety of different movement patterns that include turning and path crossing. The error in correct path detection is shown to be very small even in the most complex movement scenario.

Our results show that the Horus system achieves its goal. It has an error of less than 0.6 meter on the average and its computational requirements are more than an order of magnitude better than other WLAN location determination systems. Moreover, the techniques developed in the context of the Horus system are general and can be applied to other WLAN location determination systems to enhance their accuracy.

  Abstract                 = {Location awareness is an important part of many ubiquitous computing systems, but a perfect location system does not exist yet. Among many location tracking systems, we choose the radio frequency identification (RFID) system due to its various applications. However, the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) signals are too sensitive to the direction of the RFID reader's antenna, the orientation of the RFID tag, human interference, and the diversity of propagation media that might be present. As a result, the direct use of a conventional particle filter does not provide satisfactory tracking performance. To overcome this problem, we suggest a dual layer particle filter, where the lower layer determines the tag's location in the block level using a triangulation technique or the support vector machine (SVM) classifier, and the upper layer accurately estimates the tag's location using the conventional particle filter within the pre-computed or classified block. This layered structure improves the location estimation and the tracking performance, because the location evidence from the lower layer effectively restricts the range of possible locations of the upper layer. We implement the proposed location tracking method using a ubiquitous RFID wireless network in an intelligent office, where several RFID readers are located in fixed locations and people or objects with active RFID tags move around the office. Extensive experiments show that the proposed location tracking method is so precise and robust that it is a good choice for person or object tracking in ubiquitous computing contexts. We also validate the usefulness of the proposed location tracking method by implementing it for a real-time people monitoring system in a noisy and complex steel mill.},

In this paper, we present a system, Walk&Sketch, that creates floor plans of an indoor environment by a person walking through the environment at a normal strolling pace and taking videos using a consumer RGB-D camera. The method computes floor maps represented by polylines from a 3D point cloud based on precise frame-to-frame alignment. It aligns a reference frame with the floor and computes the frame-to-frame offsets from the continuous RGB-D input. Line segments at a certain height are extracted from the 3D point cloud, and are merged to form a polyline map, which can be further modified and annotated by users. The explored area is visualized as a sequence of polygons, providing users with the information on coverage. Experiments have done in various areas of an office building and have shown encouraging results.},

  Abstract                 = {As one of the most successful applications of image analysis and understanding, face recognition has recently received significant attention, especially during the past several years. At least two reasons account for this trend: the first is the wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications, and the second is the availability of feasible technologies after 30 years of research. Even though current machine recognition systems have reached a certain level of maturity, their success is limited by the conditions imposed by many real applications. For example, recognition of face images acquired in an outdoor environment with changes in illumination and/or pose remains a largely unsolved problem. In other words, current systems are still far away from the capability of the human perception system.This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of still- and video-based face recognition research. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of machine recognition of faces. To provide a comprehensive survey, we not only categorize existing recognition techniques but also present detailed descriptions of representative methods within each category. In addition, relevant topics such as psychophysical studies, system evaluation, and issues of illumination and pose variation are covered.},

The combination of localisation and identification capabilities provides tremendous opportunities for industry. This paper presents a study on localisation using passive RFID technology. By calibrating the propagation of radio frequency (RF) signals, we develop empirical models on readcount as a function of the distance and orientation between the antenna and the tag. Thereafter we conduct experiments to study the applicability of three widely-used localisation algorithms, namely, triangulation, near-neighbour, and Bayesian inference, for passive RFID localisation. Finally, we briefly compare three algorithms in terms of localisation error, computation time, and deployability. It is discovered that all algorithms perform reasonably well, and no algorithms actually outperform others.},

Stimuliwere visually complex and unrecognizable shapes. The unlabeled examples were sampled from a bimodal distribution with modes appearing either to the left (left-shift condition) or right (right-shift condition) of the two labeled examples. Results showed that, although initial decision boundaries were near the middle of the two labeled examples, after exposure to the unlabeled examples, they shifted in different directions in the two groups. In this respect, the human behavior conformed well to the predictions of a Gaussian mixture model for semi-supervised learning. The human behavior differed from model predictions in other interesting respects, suggesting some fruitful avenues for future inquiry.},

in home care situations. These technologies show great promise in providing high quality data to caregivers
about their family members. There are many published successes on gathering and modeling data about
older adults who need assistance, but little work on effectively delivering this data to caregivers. This
research reports on interviews with informal familial caregivers being introduced to these kinds of
technologies and what utility it may provide to them in caring for their loved ones. Interviews suggest that
nutrition, sleep quality, medication compliance, safety, and general mobility are of central concern. User
interface designers need to keep in mind familial caregivers may have very little technical support and will
likely need more assistance in learning a new technology than nursing staff. Caregivers also describe a need
for catching behavioral edge cases, as every individual has slightly different needs. When designing user-
facing tools, extra attention to the needs of caregivers will ensure assistive smart homes will be effective
tools in home care.},

programmers to make graphs with axis that have real world reliability. Sensor events are not relevant to
nursing staff, and should not be presented in their raw form. Time increments are more appropriate for this
population than number of sensor evens. With a little extra care during the design of user-facing tools, to
