{\bf Research Interests:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Artificial Intelligence, Smart Environments, Behaviometrics, Gerontechnology, Engineering of Ubiquitious Computing, Big \& Behavioral Data, User Experience


%	\item The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to the smart environment domain.  In particular, the use of these tools to improve the identification and localization of residents.  Most recently my work has spread out into seeking ways to better build and maintain smart environments for real world and eldercare deployments.
